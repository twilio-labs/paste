## Get content support

### Content office hours &mdash; sign-up only

_Content office hours are on Tuesdays. Check the UX Calendar for details._

[Use the sign up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KEMjmBdW9Q_dubGxMERP9qU9De3dMKjSsUgSwM1NBBM/edit#gid=0) to register for a slot. If there are no sign-ups an hour before the start time, the session may be cancelled.

- Slots are 30 minutes long. 
- We'll spend 5-10 minutes talking about context and reviewing what you need, then move into problem solving.
- You can invite your PM! Collaborative sessions are encouraged as they're highly effective.
- If possible, pull the content into a [CopyDoc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSUA5NnwyQzJcTMLDExF1gfW0eRWP7AhmU8L0Sfbr7s/edit?usp=sharing). This enables us and your team to focus on the words and collaborate async.

#### What to bring to office hours?
Be bold and bring early work. 
Bring your plans to discuss. 
Bring lots of ideas and variations of content. 
Bring prioritized work.

Expect to receive feedback, recommendations, and guidance during the session. Unfortunately, I can't work on your content outside of office hours - so please come prepared!

### Training and resources

Look out for information about content training sessions via email and sign up! 

Check out the latest resource: [Content for UX](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nerpH9xhsG6obgl-nKWbzwJFQva5ZU6VdNgCRJx-zVY/edit?usp=sharing).
This contains the key takeaways from the training session, action points, and tools for you to use.

### Quick self-serve checklist

How do you know if your content is "done" or "good"?

#### The tone is appropriate to the scenario.

- A stressful scenario is managed empathetically, with a knowledgeable and encouraging tone. Reassure and inform the user clearly.
- A win or success is managed genuinely, with a positive and encouraging tone. Celebrate with the user genuinely.
- A repeated interaction is managed efficiently, with a positive and conversational tone. Support the user's flow by reducing friction.
- The content sounds like a frinedly specialist.

#### The content meets the user's immediate needs.

- The user has enough information to understand the context and proposition, the impact of an action/decision, and clarity over what happens next.

#### The words and structure are as simple as they can be.

- You've replaced jargon with a simpler term or explained technical language or acronyms.
- Sentences are short.

#### The message is clear and unambiguous.

- Your content can only be interpreted one way.
- You've replaced any vague or imprecise language with precise, clear terms.

#### You've checked it. Twice.

- Capitals, punctuation, and spelling all align with this guide.
- Tip: Read it out loud to yourself. If it doesn't "sound right", consider changing the wording or phrasing.

#### Someone unfamiliar with the project has read and understood it.

- Ask them to read it out loud, then tell you what it means.
- If their understanding matches your intent, great! Your content is clear.
- If they stumble on words or don't understand, ask why. Use their feedback to iterate, then try again.

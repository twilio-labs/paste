## Access to Figma

As a Twilio Designer, you have access to Figma. Join the Twilio organization by requesting an
account through [ServiceNow](https://twilio.service-now.com/sp/). When you have access to Figma, you can learn more by reviewing our [Working with Figma guide](https://www.figma.com/file/WiJFrYa9YpIcFUmT06gTn0/Working-with-Figma).

## Using libraries

### How to turn on libraries

Paste libraries are turned on by default in Figma. If you want to control libraries per file, go to the “Assets” tab on a file, where you can also drag components into your file. Click the book icon in the upper corner. From the modal, you can turn libraries on and off. [Learn more about managing libraries](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500008731201-Manage-libraries-in-design-files).

### Main libraries

The following are the main libraries we recommend you have enabled for each Figma file. Any time a library is updated, you’ll get a notification in your project asking if you’d like to update.

#### Paste libraries

- [Paste Components](https://www.figma.com/file/l2qtpQVMmXzQPVB3rEAA8i/%5BWIP%5D-Paste-Components?node-id=3015%3A46646&t=2Fe524au9O9rlWZU-1) includes the latest components, design tokens (color, text, shadows, spacing, and sizing) in twilio, twilio-dark, default, and evergreen themes. Also [available as a Figma Community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1207476064127503112/Twilio-Paste-Components).

## Library updates

We demarcate changes with hints which you can see in the description of each update:

- 🚀&nbsp;&nbsp;**New**: [summary of a new thing]
- ✨&nbsp;&nbsp;**Improved**: [summary of an improved thing]
- 🐛&nbsp;&nbsp;**Fixed**: [summary of a bug fix]

## Fonts

Fonts in Paste are preloaded into Figma so you don't need to download or install any font files.

### Twilio Sans Text

Twilio Sans Text is used for UI text.

### Twilio Sans Display

Twilio Sans Display for headlines.

### Twilio Sans Mono

[Twilio Sans Mono](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-sans-mono) is an extensive open source programming font.

## About icons

Icons are small graphical representation of a program or a function. They can be used to enhance the
appearance of a web interface and break up the monotony of text.

## When to use icons

Use an icon only when it provides additional clarity or is necessary to draw attention to a UI element.
If an icon is used to indicate hierarchy of a UI element, all elements at the same hierarchy should also be paired with an icon.

### Accessibility

Using an icon as the only indicator of meaning is inaccessible. Different cultures may interpret the same image
in different ways and visually impaired users may not see the icon. Here are some helpful guidelines to keep in mind:

- Specify if the icon is [decorative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/) through the corresponding prop.
- If an icon isn't decorative (and thus is informative), you must describe the icon in such a way that users of
  assistive technology can infer equal meaning as a sighted user would by setting the `title` prop.
- Try to pair icons with text.
- Icons should not be interactive (i.e., clickable or focusable). They can be wrapped with an interactive element like [Button](/components/button) or [Anchor](/components/anchor).

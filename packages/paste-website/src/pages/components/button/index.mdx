## Guidelines

### About buttons

A button communicates that users can trigger an action. Places you’d use
a button include:
* Submitting a form
* Closing a modal
* Moving to the next step in a flow
A button can contain an icon and/or text. See Composing a button below
for more detailed guidelines.


### Button vs. Anchor (Link)

**TL;DR** If pressing the trigger results in a URL change, or that resultant
page makes sense as a whole new browser tab use an **Anchor** element.
Everything else is a **Button**.

It may not be immediately obvious but the semantic distinction between an
anchor and button HTML element is extremely important to learn. Without
realising it the decision can cause significant usability problems due to
the in-built behaviours, interactions and expectations that come with each.

For example, an anchor element will perform its action when clicked and
when the enter key is pressed. A button element will perform its action
when clicked and when the enter and spacebar keys are pressed. When
holding the control or command key an anchor will open a new browser
tab, a button will not.


You should:

* Use an **Anchor** when you are **navigating the user** to a new page or
place on the page
* Use a **Button** when the user is **performing an action**. An action always
happens on the same page as the trigger

If you need to link to content, you can use our [Anchor component](/components/anchor).


### Accessibility

For accessibility, the distinction becomes even more important,
especially for those who are using Assistive Technology (A.T.) such as
screen readers and dictation software. Here are some quick tips:

* Correctly choosing between an anchor or button element will help inform A.T.
users what will happen next. Will I be taken to an entirely new page or will
something happen on the current page?
* Choose button text that clearly describes the action that is about to happen
* Don’t repeat the same button text on the same page. Try not to have 20
“edit” buttons, add clarifying text, even if it’s visually hidden, to
fully describe the action. E.g. “edit home address”, “add new phone number”
* Don’t communicate with color alone. When choosing a destructive button,
make sure the button text also indicates the action is destructive
* Try not to use anchors that look like buttons. Voice dictation users will
struggle with these as they may say “click button” but the software can’t
tell what the anchor looks like visually

### Examples


<LivePreview scope={{Button}} language="jsx">
  {`<div>
  <Button variant="primary">
    Submit
  </Button>

  <Button variant="secondary">
    Submit
  </Button>

  <Button variant="destructive" size="small">
    Submit
  </Button>

  <Button variant="link">
    Submit
  </Button>

  <Button variant="destructive_link">
    Submit
  </Button>

  <Button variant="reset" size="reset">
    Submit
  </Button>
</div>`}
</LivePreview>


##### Primary button
Use a primary button to indicate the most prominent action a customer would
make on a screen. It should be a safe and if possible, reversible action
without much cost.

Try to use only one primary button on a screen. Using multiple might be
distracting.


##### Secondary button
The secondary button is the most frequently used button.

Use a secondary button to indicate an action that should be easy for a customer
to make but isn’t the most prominent on a screen. It should be a safe and if
possible, reversible action without much cost.

##### Destructive button
A destructive button indicates a destructive action, such as “Delete” or
“Remove”, that might be difficult to reverse. If possible, give users
the ability to undo the action, or at least, confirm the action.

##### Icon-only button
Use icon-only buttons sparingly.

They should be used only in compact UI situations. Use an icon that can
only convey a single action.

##### Link-style button
Use link-style buttons when other types of buttons may be too distracting.

##### Small button
Use small buttons sparingly, only when needed for vertical density.
Guidelines for using variants in small buttons are the same as in
their default size.


### States

##### Loading
Use the loading state if the action doesn’t happen instantly.
The button is also disabled in this state.

However, the loading state may make an action appear to take longer
than it does and doesn’t communicate what’s preventing the action
from completing. Use it when you can’t move the user to the next state.

##### Disabled
Use the disabled state sparingly.

The customer shouldn't have to guess why a button is disabled.
It should be immediately obvious to the customer why a button
might be disabled (*e.g.*, if it follows a single empty text
field). Otherwise, show the button in its default state, then
provide helpful error text after it's pressed.



### Composing a button
In most cases, you’ll use a text-only button.

Button text should:
* Use sentence case (“Log in”, not “Log In”)
* Clearly indicate what’ll happen when a user presses it.
* Start with a verb, except for a common action like “Done.”
* Be concise without sacrificing clarity and user confidence.

Pair text with an icon only if the icon clarifies the meaning of
the button. Use no more than one icon before text and one icon after text.


### When to use a button
Use a button to indicate that users can trigger an action.

In general, align buttons to the direction of the text (*e.g.*,
left-aligned in English) for easy scannability.

When moving customers through a sequence, place the primary button in
the direction of the movement (e.g., a “Next” button goes on the
right in an English-language flow).


<DoDont>
  <Do>
    Prioritize actions on a screen. Only one primary button should be used
    on each screen so users are clear about what the intended action is.
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    Don’t use many primary buttons on a screen, which may distract users.
  </Dont>
</DoDont>

<DoDont>
  <Do>
    Use the right variant to communicate meaning and hierarchy.
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    Don’t use a button variant for an action it’s not intended for.
  </Dont>
</DoDont>


<DoDont>
  <Do>
    Write button text that is clear, starts with a verb, and
    helps users confidently trigger an action.
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    Don’t use product or brand icons in buttons since they don’t communicate action.
  </Dont>
</DoDont>

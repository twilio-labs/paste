# File Picker

## To do

- Fix type (ts error on `accept` prop)
- Docs
- Tests
- Finalize stories
- use an aria property to link the file name text and the input

## Notes for docs

- `accept` prop - doesn't necessarily validate or block types, just allows the browser to suggest specific types https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept. Note: consumers should implement server-side validation
- always use label with file picker, same guidance as input

## Open questions

- Clicking 'no files selected' doesn't open the file browser
- Clicking the composed Label doesn't open the file browser (2 htmlFors)
- What should be `element="FILEPICKER"`?

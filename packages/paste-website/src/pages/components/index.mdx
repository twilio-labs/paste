The components listed here are on our roadmap. Only a few of them are available today.

If you’re planning on using an alpha or beta component, please check in with the Paste team through the <strong>#help-design-system</strong> channel on Slack.

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle as="h4">Don't see a utility or component you need listed here?</CalloutTitle>
  <UL>
    <LI>
      First off, we recommend{' '}
      <Anchor href="https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/issues">creating an issue on GitHub</Anchor> with your
      component / utility proposal.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      While not all requests are accepted for the design system, we may be able to suggest suitable alternatives - for
      this, drop us a note on #help-design-system or join our Weekly Office hours.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      We've also writtten a guide for{' '}
      <Anchor href="/tokens/how-to-compose-custom-ui-with-tokens">
        how you can build custom components with Tokens
      </Anchor>{' '}
      and still benefit from Paste design updates
    </LI>
  </UL>
</Callout>

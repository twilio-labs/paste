## Purpose

The DSYS committee aims to create alignment across teams to enable more trusting, consistent, and elevated Twilio user experiences.

We want to ensure the [design systems team](https://paste.twilio.design/) is collecting feedback from across Twilio teams and products in a consistent and actionable way.

We can't build a system without the input of the teams who use it, so thank you for your participation on the committee!

## Expectations

**Estimated weekly time commitment:**

- 30-minute meeting
- 1–2 hours of review

### **All committee members** are expected to:

- Communicate the needs of your product, UX/engineering subgroup, and peers with regard to components, patterns, flows, and documentation.
  - _For example:_
  - For console FE, that means the needs of console product and FE engineers
  - For Flex PD, that means the needs of Flex product and product designers
  - _Example of needs: [DateTimePicker use cases across Twilio products](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYaDr4PMhgomT0MrnjiShfiVIK8m9tdBW1ntenPMq7M/edit#bookmark=id.3z8hv1w1kimw)_
- Provide feedback on the docs and designs sent for review before each meeting.
  - _Examples of what we ask for feedback on: [DateTimePicker API explorations](https://codesandbox.io/s/datetime-picker-api-u4q0p), [Status pattern spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oqJnVcsbi6dvxxozxyk-qR32n0rmptM7G0_tP6e1oXs/edit), [Data export pattern design](https://www.figma.com/file/Jl7DBt1v1M5yfYPmdibzxc/Data-handling-pattern?node-id=133%3A0)_
- Serve as a proxy for any customer research that may materially impact the work.
- Give your Support rating for the work.
- If you can't attend a future meeting, please let us know as far ahead as you can.
  - Provide feedback before each meeting as usual (or as otherwise discussed with a design systems member).
  - We'll follow up in Slack after each meeting with the action items discussed, and ask for your status on the review tracker async.

There are 2 engineering meetings and 3 design meetings.

### **UX team committee members** are expected to:

- Attend ad hoc kickoffs and workshops.
- Rally your peers to read docs and designs and share timely feedback.
- Create or facilitate creating the design of product prototypes for customer research.

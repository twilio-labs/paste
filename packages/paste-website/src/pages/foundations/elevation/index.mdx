## Introduction

Elevation represents how "close" or "far" an element feels from the user in a digital context, using a combination of **shadows**, **colors**, **borders**, and **overlays** to create a layering effect, making elements feel distinct, focused or prioritized.

Paste’s elevation system is:

- Subtle: Provides just enough visual contrast to create a sense of depth, avoiding excessive visual clutter.
- Intentional: Provides clear meaning to guide users through interfaces, improving user efficiency by consistently communicating the level of importance of elements across different pages.
- Dynamic: Adapts to different background colors and themes, ensuring consistent depth perception and usability across light, dark, and custom design contexts.

## Elevation levels

Paste has a total of 4 levels of elevation, each elevation level corresponds to a perceived distance within the interface. All components are assigned a level based on their intended distance against the surface behind them.

### Level 0

Elements at this level are the baseline for all the other levels and represent the background of the interface.

The majority of elements will be at this level in their resting states, however an element on this level can move to a higher level when interacted with.

For example: a Button might be ‘Level 0’ in its resting state, but ‘Level 1’ when hovered.

### Level 1

Elements that rest in this level require subtle differentiation from the surface behind them without floating on top of other elements.

There are 2 different ways to communicate an element's elevation in level 1:

#### Applying Level 1 elevation

**Use borders** when a group of elements requires focus to complete a task while maintaining a close relationship with the surrounding content.

<ApplyingLevel1ImgCaption />

**Use a tonal difference** when elements provide context for a functionality or task, making it visibly clearer what needs to be done.

*Temporary raised interactive (hover) elements can use a tonal difference to provide additional emphasis.

### Level 2

Elements that rest at this level are commonly distinctly separated from the background and dynamically overlap content layers and/or are bound to Level 0 elements.

There are 2 different ways to communicate an element's elevation in level 2:

#### Applying Level 2 elevation

**Use a tonal difference along with a border**, when an element holds global actions that may be needed at any point in the experience.

**Use a soft, sharp shadow** for elements that have temporary prominence or subtly float above the content.

*Interactive states like vertical or horizontal scroll can dynamically use a soft, sharp shadow to indicate that there is overflown content.

### Level 3

Elements that sit at this level, float above all other levels, and tend to contain crucial actions or information that temporarily becomes the top hierarchy of the surface.

<ResponsiveImage src={TokensDiagram} alt="" />

#### Applying Level 3 elevation

**Use a border and large, soft shadow**, for elements that are at the top priority and require user focus, but still allow the user to interact with the surrounding content.

<ResponsiveImage src={TokensDiagram} alt="" />

**Use a large soft shadow along with an overlay** for elements that completely isolate the interface to draw full focus from the user.

## Elevated background color tokens

Subtle tonal shifts are an effective way to communicate hierarchy and prominence for elevated elements without adding visual clutter to the screen.

Paste's elevated background color tokens are derived from a base background color with tonal shifts to indicate elevation.
Elevated surfaces darken on light backgrounds and lighten on dark backgrounds, ensuring clarity and consistency across themes.

## Elevated border color tokens

Borders are used across all elevation levels to reinforce separation and define contours. At lower elevations, they provide a lightweight alternative to shadows, while at higher levels, they combine with shadows or tonal changes to emphasize hierarchy and distinguish elements.

Like background color tokens, elevated border color tokens are derived from a base background color with tonal shifts to represent elevation.

### Callout: Different uses of color

- **Elevation Colors**: Subtle tones for prominence and hierarchy, used to separate elements visually from the background.
- **Semantic Colors**: Used to communicate meaning or status, such as success, warning, or error.
- **Decorative Colors**: Reflect the brand identity or give a branded feel to a composition.

Tip: use elevation colors for hierarchy, semantic colors for purpose, and branded colors for identity and style.

## Shadow tokens

Shadows are the most extreme way to display elevation. Overuse of shadows without understanding your page’s visual hierarchy can have a negative effect on the user experience.

**Level 2 shadows** are small and sharp and indicate a close distance with the surface behind them. Shadows used in dark backgrounds use a slightly darker hue so the perceived depth is consistent.

**Level 3 shadows** are larger and softer, this indicates a further distance from the surface behind them. Shadows used in dark backgrounds use a slightly darker hue so the perceived depth is consistent.

# Paste Design Library Standards

These guidelines are specific to our workflow in Figma.

## Code of conduct

- Give at least 24 hours to provide feedback, since we‚Äôre a distributed team.
- Don‚Äôt give feedback on work that‚Äôs üöß in progress.
- _But_, don‚Äôt silo your work. Be ready to, at least, acknowledge comments and ideas when there‚Äôs visible work.
- If a feedback thread grows long, proactively set up a meeting to address disagreements or hash out points of confusion.
- Keep feedback relevant to what stage the work is in.
- See more detail on our review process in our [Release and Testing Guidelines](./designer-workflow.md).

### Naming conventions

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Type</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Naming convention</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Rationale</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Libraries</strong>
<p>
Such as the component library or the theme library.
   </td>
   <td>Title Case
<p>
e.g. ‚ÄúPaste Components‚Äù
   </td>
   <td>Because it is the formal title of the library.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Components</strong>
<p>
Includes the name of the component itself and the name of the page in the library.
   </td>
   <td>Title Case
<p>
e.g. ‚ÄúRadio Group‚Äù
   </td>
   <td>Because it is the formal title of the component and to align with the casing used on the docs site.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Non-editable layers</strong>
<p>
Layers that shouldn‚Äôt be edited when the component is used in design work, like foundational styles.
   </td>
   <td>Sentence case
<p>
e.g. ‚ÄúBottom border‚Äù
   </td>
   <td>To avoid confusion between regular layers and components in the Layers panel.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Editable layers</strong>
<p>
Layers that are intended to be edited when the component is used in design work, like text in a toast message.
   </td>
   <td>Sentence case w/ pencil
<p>
e.g. ‚Äú‚úèÔ∏è Heading text‚Äù
<p>
<em>When an editable layer is nested within one or more groups/frames for layout purposes, include a ‚Äú‚Üì‚Äù at the end of the group/frame name to help designers find the editable layer (e.g. ‚ÄúContent ‚Üì‚Äù). PDs should be able to follow arrows from the top layer level down to the editable layer.</em>
   </td>
   <td>To align with non-editable layers while also adding clarity around which layers are editable.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Configurable layers</strong>
<p>
For more complex components, we will need to nest components that have configurable props, such as a Checkbox component within the Checkbox Group component, which has a Selected prop.
   </td>
   <td>Sentence case w/ gear
<p>
e.g. ‚Äú‚öôÔ∏è Checkbox‚Äù
<p>
<em>When a configurable layer is nested within one or more groups/frames for layout purposes, include a ‚Äú‚Üì‚Äù at the end of the group/frame name to help designers find the configurable layer (e.g. ‚ÄúContent ‚Üì‚Äù). PDs should be able to follow arrows from the top layer level down to the configurable layer.</em>
   </td>
   <td>To align with other layers while also adding clarity around which layers are configurable.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Component prop names and values</strong>
<p>
Such as primary and secondary buttons or interaction states on Tabs.
   </td>
   <td>Sentence case
<p>
e.g. ‚ÄúVariant=Destructive secondary‚Äù
<p>
<em>Prop names should match equivalent props in the API when applicable, but we should shorten prop names when their full names truncate in the Design panel.</em>
   </td>
   <td>To align with the casing used in the rest of the Design panel in Figma.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Component prop values <em>that are tokens</em></strong>
<p>
Such as sizing tokens to specify the size of an Avatar.
   </td>
   <td>Kebab case + hard value in parentheses
<p>
E.g. ‚Äúsize-110 (64px)‚Äù
   </td>
   <td>To align with the tokens page on the docs site and to make it clear when a value is a token.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Text and layer styles</strong>
<p>
Such as text colors and background colors represented by tokens in Paste.
   </td>
   <td>Kebab case
<p>
E.g. ‚Äúcolor-text-weak‚Äù
   </td>
   <td>Same as above.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Page organization

[TBD](https://issues.corp.twilio.com/browse/DSYS-2575)

- Put a ‚Äúüß∞‚Äù emoji at the start of the page name if it contains resources specific to that library (e.g. cover sheet, local assets)

### Component organization

- Provide a description for every Component in the ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù field about how and when it should be used. Provide descriptions for certain component variants/props when needed (e.g. it would be helpful on the Primary variant of Button to explain that there should only be one per page).
- Provide a docs link for every component in the ‚ÄúDocumentation‚Äù field _(and probably somewhere on the Component page, like Polaris and Primer do, because that built-in docs link is pretty hidden)._
- Try to have just one Component for a given component in Paste whenever possible (e.g. do not make separate components for a Primary Button and a Secondary Button; instead, make one Button component with Primary and Secondary variants).
- For any components or variants that have design that isn‚Äôt available on the coded component yet, append the page name and component name with ‚Äú(dev)‚Äù, and add a note to the description that the changes aren‚Äôt yet reflected in Paste.

### Component composition

- Components should use text styles and layer styles from the [Paste Default Theme library](https://www.figma.com/file/OZKRQFOkOAl413m5JVIYE6/Paste-Default-Theme) that correspond to the implementation in code.
  - If the style doesn‚Äôt exist, take the new token proposal to the design systems team. Create the next text or layer style if the team agrees.
- All spacing in components should be possible with the Paste spacing tokens. In general, space layers on a base 4px scale. Use 2px when necessary for small spaces.
- Components should be clean and usable by product designers. They should:
  - Have no redundant groups or frames that don‚Äôt serve a purpose.
  - Have locked layers for anything that we don‚Äôt let Paste consumers control, and vice versa.
  - Be pinned to the top left (in most cases) and have auto-layout rules set to mimic the behavior in production.
  - Have auto-layout rules set so that text overrides will automatically resize the symbol (unless the component is meant to be fixed in height or width).
  - Whenever possible, do not force PDs to hide/unhide layers in the layers panel. Instead, expose the variations as props on the component (e.g. Button has an Icon prop to have a prefix or suffix icon, rather than PDs needing to hide/show the icons themselves).
  - For components that can have custom content inside of them (e.g. Card, Disclosure), have a variant that shows the spacing (using the Spacing component from the [Asset Documentation library](https://www.figma.com/file/GfY11A2VW638eFK48nDtdE/Asset-Documentation-Library)) to help designers align content correctly.
    - If the spacing is modifiable (e.g. Card), leave the Spacing component unlocked and add a Description that the spacing is adjustable.
  - For any icon layers used in a component, apply the ‚Äúutilities (figma-specific)/transparent‚Äù background color to make it easier to click on that layer.
    - For icon layers, make sure the icon glyph layer name is `icon`. This allows for the icon to retain the same color if the icon is swapped.
- Component props should be 1:1 with the component API as much as possible.
  - Default, error, and disabled states (at least) should be available in Figma.
  - Hover states should include the appropriate cursor to make mocking up prototypes easier for PDs.
  - All variants available in the component API should be available in Figma. There may be some exceptions, such as the ‚Äúreset‚Äù variant on buttons.
- TODO: In what order do we list properties for variants?
- TODO: How do we decide which props to expose at the top level of a component vs. nesting? Maybe a max number of top-level variants? Maybe think about it in terms of [the obvious, the easy, and the possible](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3047-the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible)?

### Pattern organization

TODO - will share lots of the above standards, so might not need its own section

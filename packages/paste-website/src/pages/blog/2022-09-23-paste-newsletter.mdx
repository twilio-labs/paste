## üì£ What's new in Paste

### ALL the new components!

#### Switch

![](/images/gifs-2022-09-23-paste-newsletter/switch-example.gif)

The Switch component makes interacting with binary states a breeze.
Our Switch incorporates animation and icons to make its pressed/unpressed state visually clear, while its built-in
accessibility features communicate the state clearly to users. Take it for a spin!

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/switch">Check out the Switch docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

#### Inline Code

![](../../assets/images/articles/2022-09-23-paste-newsletter/inline-code-example.png)

If your snippet of code is small and inline with the rest of your text,
Inline Code is the way to go. Its contents stand out with a subtle background and monospace font.
Use it for code, ID&apos;s, and keys.

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/inline-code">Check out the Inline Code docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

#### Code Block

![](/images/gifs-2022-09-23-paste-newsletter/code-block-example.gif)

Presenting Code Block! This component allows you to display code with syntax highlighting for 13 programming languages.
It features tabs to show different blocks of code in the same area, a copy code button, and an optional external link button leading to the source code.

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/code-block">Check out the Code Block docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

#### Callout

![](../../assets/images/articles/2022-09-23-paste-newsletter/callout-example.png)

With five different variants to choose from, all your imperative, static information will be
hard to miss inside of the Callout component! Don&apos;t forget to set its heading level according
to the outline of your page for the best user experience.

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/callout">Check out the Callout docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

#### Minimizable Dialog

![](/images/gifs-2022-09-23-paste-newsletter/minimizable-dialog-example.gif)

As part of our Conversations UI kit, we&apos;ve added the Minimizable Dialog component.
Its power lies in its flexibility; use it with a static button, a floating button, or use its included state hook
for full control of its internal state. Making a chat log has never been easier with Paste.

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/minimizable-dialog">Check out the Minimizable Dialog docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

#### 42 new icons, including a full suite of contact center icons!

![](../../assets/images/articles/2022-09-23-paste-newsletter/new-icons-example.png)

We&apos;ve got new icons! A full suite of contact center icons and more are now available.

Our Conversations UI Kit, which includes all of Paste&apos;s chat components and the new minimizable dialog,
is now available in Figma. The components in this kit work together seamlessly for designing conversational UI,
no matter the complexity.

### Updated Components

#### Button variant: toggle!

![](/images/gifs-2022-09-23-paste-newsletter/toggle-button-example.gif)

Let&apos;s toggle! To make a button a toggle simply add the `pressed` prop to a secondary button or secondary icon button.

Table and Data Grid components are now available! Use this functionality to make perusing data easier,
especially on mobile viewports. Thanks Mark! üéâ

We are excited to the share the following insights:

<Paragraph>
  When asked how strongly they agreed to{' '}
  <strong>Paste being easy to use to design and build customer interfaces</strong>, our participants averaged{' '}
  <strong>4.00/5</strong>.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  When asked how strongly they agreed to <strong>being proud of the behavior of their products when using Paste</strong>,

Since our last update, Ramona Thompson joined the [One Twilio BPM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mH5ImzP5Kzb_nVKOHoTksr5jOY0aG6cbqtcEKbFlLYU/edit#bookmark=kix.xj165t52alhv) crew to partner with us in our
user research efforts. Ramona collaborated with us to help us dig into what customers consider friendly,
clean, and more importantly what feels like Twilio. She led research to measure how a new visual
design direction performed against existing customer ratings of live Twilio products, as well as how
different brand expressions &#40;think typography, color, and illustration&#41; impact our customers'
perception and preferences. Ramona was a üåüsuperstarüåü in our research phase and we are grateful for her efforts.

## Usage

### General

Use a confirmation to ask the user to verify that they want to proceed with a complex action, or one with significant or unanticipated consequences (like irreversibility). Confirmation messages are always triggered by an initial user action.
Confirmations are displayed using an [Alert Dialog](/components/alert-dialog), since it requires the user to interact with the component.

### Composition notes

Each confirmation [Alert Dialog](/components/alert-dialog) should follow a predictable content pattern. 

#### Heading

The [Heading](/components/heading) should be phrased as a question. In general:
- Avoid using articles like “the” or “a.” 
- Avoid the phrase “Are you sure?” 
- Use sentence case.

#### Paragraph (optional)

The [Paragraph](/components/paragraph) should include 1-3 sentences that explain the outcomes of the actions. If the action is irreversible, say so.

#### Buttons
Confirmation messages typically have 2 [Buttons](/components/button): one that confirms the action and another that offers an alternative. Labels should be short and mirror the language in the title whenever possible.

## Variations

Confirmation messages are used in a variety of situations where it’s important to confirm that the user wants to proceed with an action, like saving changes before exiting, starting a process that could incur unexpected costs, or [deleting something](/patterns/delete).

| Use case  | Sample text | Sample CTAs |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| User wants to [delete](/patterns/delete) something  | **Delete [thing]?** <br/> You’re deleting [object name]. You cannot undo this action. | Cancel \| Delete [thing]  |
| User wants to [delete](/patterns/delete) something that has major consequences  | **Delete [thing]?** <br/> When you delete [thing], all [objects] are permanently deleted. You cannot undo this action. Enter [user input] to delete [thing] | Cancel \| Delete [thing]  |
| User wants to change something | **Change [thing]?** <br/> When you change [thing], your [objects] are deleted. | Cancel \| Change [thing] |
| User wants to leave a flow but may want to save changes | **Save changes?** <br/> If you close without saving, changes are lost. | Close without saving \| Save and close |
| User wants to leave a flow but changes can’t be saved | **Stop [doing thing]?** <br/> Your changes will not be saved. | Keep [doing thing] \| Stop [doing thing] |
| User wants to perform an action that has implications for resources (money, credits, etc.) | **Use title to repeat action** <br/> Explain what could happen to the resource, and offer other options if available and appropriate. | _Offer clear alternatives_ |

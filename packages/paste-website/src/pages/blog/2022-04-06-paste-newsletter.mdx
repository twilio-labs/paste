## üöÄ What's new

### Paste goes international!

![An example of Paste's form-pill-group component in French](../../assets/images/articles/2022-04-06-paste-newsletter/i18n-pill-group.png)

To better support Twilio‚Äôs global efforts, Paste now supports all P1 languages. This includes a mechanism to swap the font for non-latin character sets, such as Japanese, to get a really crisp UI.

There are some components that need a bit of extra attention when being used for
multiple languages (for example, [Anchor requires an additional prop for i18n](/components/anchor/#internationalization)).
Look for [an "internationalization" example](/components/button/#internationalization) on component docs pages to know whether a given component needs any updates in order to be translated into other languages.

### Paste Dark theme is ready for you!

![An screenshot of the dark theme toggle on the Paste website, with dark theme selected](../../assets/images/articles/2022-04-06-paste-newsletter/dark-theme-switcher.png)

We are excited to share that the Dark theme is coming out of early preview and is ready for general availability! We incorporated your feedback (buttons are fixed, y‚Äôall!), and we brought the Dark theme up to our accessibility and inclusive design standards. The Dark theme improvements are now live on the Paste site, so head on over and switch the toggle in the topmast to ‚ÄúDark‚Äù to check it out.

### The Badge component enters Stage 2

![The new and improved Badge component in Paste](../../assets/images/articles/2022-04-06-paste-newsletter/badge-2.png)

A big [Badge component](/components/badge/) update improves the look in both the default and dark themes, as well as improving the interactivity for clickable Badges. We‚Äôve also introduced ‚Äúdecorative‚Äù variants that can be used for attributes that don‚Äôt have a semantic meaning but would still benefit from the visual hierarchy of a Badge.

### Introducing the Filter Group pattern

![Screenshot of a Filter Group pattern example](../../assets/images/articles/2022-04-06-paste-newsletter/filter-group-pattern-demo.png)

Many of Twilio‚Äôs interfaces involve displaying data in tables.
Some tables are so complex that our users need an easy way to navigate
the data. [Introducing the Filter Group pattern](/patterns/filter-group); with this guidance we
hope to better serve the customer by improving consistency in filtering throughout Twilio products. Thank you to our committee members for working through this complex design challenge with us!

### New Data Visualization foundations

![Screenshot of a line chart using Paste data visualization tokens](../../assets/images/articles/2022-04-06-paste-newsletter/data-visualization-demo.png)

Representing data with visualizations is a tremendous UX
improvement when used appropriately, however it‚Äôs a challenge
getting the UI right. Paste is ramping up [guidance and tooling
to make building beautiful and accessible data visualizations](/foundations/data-visualization)
less difficult. Thank you to the Voice & Video team and our committee members for their feedback and care as we work through this problem space.

## ‚ö° Pastemates‚Ñ¢

<em>
  Pastemates are individuals and teams who have been critical contributors to Paste, through advocating for adoption
  within their products and channeling important feedback and contributions back into the system.
</em>

![Photo of this month's Pastemates. Left: Kate Hsiao. Center: Tess Hannel. Right: Zach Kuzmic.](../../assets/images/articles/2022-04-06-paste-newsletter/pastemates.png)

We couldn‚Äôt keep it to just one Pastemate this time around; our Pastemates this release are Kate Hsiao, Tess Hannel,
and Zach Kuzmic! This Twilio Segment dream team is leading [UX Infrastructure‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Twilio‚Äù priority](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mH5ImzP5Kzb_nVKOHoTksr5jOY0aG6cbqtcEKbFlLYU/edit#bookmark=id.w002x1xn40l) this year, and
they‚Äôve been working tirelessly to pave the way for a unified One Twilio experience across all of our current and future product UI.

They‚Äôve performed audits and gap analyses, written software design docs, and interviewed internal stakeholders on their vision for ‚ÄúOne Twilio‚Äù, and that‚Äôs only the beginning. Their work this year will help to evolve the Twilio product design language and establish the playbook for new companies to adopt Paste as the product design language, to ensure seamless user experiences across all Twilio‚Äôs products.

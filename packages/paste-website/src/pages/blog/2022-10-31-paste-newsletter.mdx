## üì£ What's new in Paste

### Radio Button Group

<ResponsiveImage src={RadioButtonGroup} />

Radio Buttons are here! This component is functionally similar to the Radio Group, but renders the controls visually as buttons instead of radios. They can be used either attached, like in the above screenshot, or unattached, for two stylistic varieties.

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="#/components/radio-button-group">Check out the Radio Button Group docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

### Button Group

<ResponsiveImage src={ButtonGroup} />

The Button Group component is stylistically similar to the Radio Button Group, but doesn‚Äôt operate as a Radio Group. The Button Group is used for sets of related actions, rather than mutually exclusive options, that would otherwise be separate buttons.

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/button-group">Check out the Button Group docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

### Side Modal

<ResponsiveImage src={SideModal} />

Presenting Code Block! This component allows you to display code with syntax highlighting for 13 programming languages.
It features tabs to show different blocks of code in the same area, a copy code button, and an optional external link button leading to the source code.

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/code-block">Check out the Code Block docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

### File Picker

<ResponsiveImage src={FilePicker} />

Say goodbye to those boring, native `input type=‚Äùfile‚Äù`s, and say hello to our styled File Picker! This component is actually the native HTML element under the hood, so you get all the same functionality, but we Pastified it so that it fits seamlessly into your form layouts.

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/file-picker">Check out the File Picker docs</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

### Additional updates

#### New

- Inverse components in Figma (Anchor, Button, Combobox, Help Text, Input, and Select)!

#### Improvements

- [Avatar component - new "Entity" variant for non-person representations](/components/avatar/#avatar-variants)

<ResponsiveImage src={Brandon} />

Brandon Templar just recently joined Twilio, but has already hit the ground running. He‚Äôs partnering with Segment and the UX Infrastructure team to lead the Evergreen-UI to Paste migration efforts. Brandon has demonstrated excellent collaboration, empathy, and a structured way of thinking to help dig into the specifics around migrating between two large design systems. He rallied many teams in creative ways to collect feedback and is the only designer outside of our team to ever leverage our reporting infrastructure to get quantitative data in his research. We have enjoyed our partnership with Brandon and are grateful for his efforts.

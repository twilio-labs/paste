# Standard Operating Procedures

These questions are ordered for a more natural progression.

## Terminology

- A "consumer" is an individual, a team, or an organization that has a focused scope of concern and their own environment.
- A "product" is any project, code snippet, or deliverable to be leveraged by **consumers**.

A good example of developing a product for multiple consumers would be the `React` library.

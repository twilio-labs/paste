TO DO

- BUG: step=3 value starts at 0 and first step goes to 1 then starts stepping correctly
- tests and more stories (controlled & uncontrolled)
- MONDAY: ask about hover/focus styles on reset button, add to ticket
  - if so, add to ticket AC to adjust hover/focus styles on number nudger buttons too or make another ticket dependent on the button one

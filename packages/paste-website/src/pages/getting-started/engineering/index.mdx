## Installation

### Dependencies

Paste is developed with the [React front-end library](https://reactjs.org/). In order
to use Paste, your project first needs React. Install it by using this terminal
command from within your project's folder:

<Box marginBottom="space30">
  <Table tableLayout="fixed">
    <THead>
      <Tr>
        <Th>Package</Th>
        <Th>Version</Th>
      </Tr>
    </THead>
    <TBody>
      <Tr>
        <Td>react</Td>
        <Td>{Package.dependencies['react']}</Td>
      </Tr>
      <Tr>
        <Td>react-dom</Td>
        <Td>{Package.dependencies['react-dom']}</Td>
      </Tr>
      <Tr>
        <Td>prop-types</Td>
        <Td>{Package.dependencies['prop-types']}</Td>
      </Tr>
    </TBody>
  </Table>
</Box>

```shell
# yarn
yarn add react react-dom prop-types

# npm
npm install react react-dom prop-types
```

<Box marginBottom="space100" />

### Paste Packages

<Callout variant="information">
  <CalloutTitle>Our packages are published on NPM</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    Check out <Anchor href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm">the NPM docs</Anchor> to learn more about these commands
    and how these packages are installed.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

Paste has two packages to get started: `@twilio-paste/core` and `@twilio-paste/icons`.
Paste Core includes all the component and libraries, while Paste Icons
includes all the icon illustrations. [Read about how Paste keeps your bundles small](#how-the-core-package-stays-lean).

<Box marginBottom="space30">
  <Table tableLayout="fixed">
    <THead>
      <Tr>
        <Th>Package</Th>
        <Th>Version</Th>
      </Tr>
    </THead>
    <TBody>
      <Tr>
        <Td>@twilio-paste/core</Td>
        <Td>{coreVersion}</Td>
      </Tr>
      <Tr>
        <Td>@twilio-paste/icons</Td>
        <Td>{iconsVersion}</Td>
      </Tr>
    </TBody>
  </Table>
</Box>

```shell
# yarn
yarn add @twilio-paste/core @twilio-paste/icons

# npm
npm install @twilio-paste/core @twilio-paste/icons
```

<Box marginBottom="space100" />

### Setting up the Theme Provider

Once the Paste dependencies are installed, you must import the [Paste Theme](/tokens/theme-package/) at the root of your application. Failure to
do so will result in broken styles in our components. This Provider ensures the Paste components display the correct tokens for the selected theme.

```jsx
import {Theme} from '@twilio-paste/core/theme';

// Wrap your root component with the Theme.Provider like so:
const App = () => (
  <Theme.Provider theme="default">
    <RestOfYourAppInHere />
  </Theme.Provider>
);
```

<Box marginBottom="space140" />

## Usage

### Paste Components

You can use the Paste components anywhere that is wrapped by the [Theme Provider](#setting-up-the-theme-provider). The Paste tokens
are readily available on our components and typescript typings are provided.

```jsx
import {Box} from '@twilio-paste/core/box';

const Component = () => (
  <Box margin="space20" backgroundColor="colorBackground">
    Hello Paste!
  </Box>
);
```

<Box marginBottom="space100" />

### Jest / Testing

Just like rendering Paste components in a web application, when rendering components for the purposes of testing you
are required to wrap them in the [Theme Provider](#setting-up-the-theme-provider). If you do not, your components may fail to render correctly.

It can sometimes be helpful to test Paste components without animation. To disable animations on Paste components, pass the `disableAnimations` boolean prop to the &lt;Theme.Provider&gt;.

<Box marginBottom="space100" />

### Using Icons

The Paste Icons package provides icon components. They can be used to enhance the appearance of a web interface and break
up the monotony of text. Icons have to be imported individually.

<Box marginBottom="space30">
  <Table tableLayout="fixed">
    <THead>
      <Tr>
        <Th>Package</Th>
        <Th>Version</Th>
      </Tr>
    </THead>
    <TBody>
      <Tr>
        <Td>@twilio-paste/icons</Td>
        <Td>{iconsVersion}</Td>
      </Tr>
    </TBody>
  </Table>
</Box>

```shell
# yarn
yarn add @twilio-paste/icons

# npm
npm install @twilio-paste/icons
```

Then you can use an icon inside your app:

```jsx
import {PlusIcon} from '@twilio-paste/icons/esm/PlusIcon';

const Component = () => (
  <Button variant="secondary" size="small" onClick={() => {}}>
    <PlusIcon decorative={true} />
    Add to cart
  </Button>
);
```

For more information about our icon system, checkout our [usage guide here](/icon-system/).

  <CalloutText>
    You can view and play with icons on{' '}
    <Anchor href="https://twilio-labs.github.io/paste/?path=/story/overview-icons--list">
      our storybook icon list
    </Anchor>
    . Our icon set is still limited, and more will be added over time. Please <Anchor href="https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/issues">
      file an icon request
    </Anchor> or follow the guide on <Anchor href="/icon-system/how-to-add-an-icon">how to add an icon</Anchor>.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

<Box marginBottom="space100" />

### Global Styles

Many apps/websites utilize global stylesheets. Even though Paste styles are scoped at the component level, global styles can creep
in and cause some havoc. Make sure to thoroughly test Paste components to verify everything looks as they should.

<Box marginBottom="space100" />

### Fonts

Paste leaves it up to you to load the fonts needed for the theme you've selected. Console uses Whitney ScreenSmart
and SendGrid uses Colfax. More often than not you are working within existing SendGrid and Twilio Console applications
and these fonts are automatically loaded for you.

#### Special note on Whitney

The Whitney font is loaded by the Typography.com service and is only allowed on \*.twilio.com domains as well as localhost.
Make sure to serve your app from the correct hostname if you're having issues with font loading.

If you are not working in an existing Twilio Console experience, you can include the following link element in your sites `head`
to load these fonts if you are serving your application from \*.twilio.com domains.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//cloud.typography.com/6230892/752864/css/fonts.css">
```

#### Special note on Inter

The default theme (UDL theme) uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) as its primary font family.
This is a free font that is [hosted on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter). Feel free to copy
[how we load the font](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/blob/main/packages/paste-website/src/assets/css/fonts.css#L105)
into your own app if you are using the default theme.

## Additional information

### Core package list

Core gives you the following packages. You can install these packages individually as well.

<Disclosure>
  <DisclosureHeading as="h4" variant="heading50">
    Show full package list
  </DisclosureHeading>
  <DisclosureContent>
    <Table tableLayout="fixed">
      <THead>
        <Tr>
          <Th>Package</Th>
          <Th>Version</Th>
        </Tr>
      </THead>
      <TBody>
        {Object.keys(coreDependencies).map((dependency, index) => {
          return (
            <Tr key={`core-dep-${dependency}-${index}`}>
              <Td>{dependency}</Td>
              <Td>{coreDependencies[dependency]}</Td>
            </Tr>
          );
        })}
      </TBody>
    </Table>
  </DisclosureContent>

### How the Core package stays lean

Unlike other bundled libraries, using Core and Icons won't load _all of_ Paste into your product's bundle, it will only include the parts you are importing.
This happens automatically, without any requirement for a tree-shaking config in your builds.

You may have imported from other libraries like this:

```jsx
import {Box, Anchor, Button, Theme} from '@twilio-paste/core';
import {DisclosureIcon, DeleteIcon} from '@twilio-paste/icons';
```

The problem with importing this way is that the [referenced "main" file](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/blob/main/packages/paste-core/components/button/package.json#L10)
in these packages has to bundle all the different pieces together. This causes everything to be loaded even if we only need one small feature.
With over 50 icons in our Icon package and 40 components in Core - with more being added continuously - this can become very heavy very quickly.

In Paste, we use an "unbarreled" import mechanism, so the above would look like this:

```jsx
import {Box} from '@twilio-paste/core/box';
import {Anchor} from '@twilio-paste/core/anchor';
import {Button} from '@tiwlio-paste/core/button';
import {Theme} from '@twilio-paste/core/theme';
import {DisclosureIcon} from '@twilio-paste/icons/esm/DisclosureIcon';
import {DeleteIcon} from '@twilio-paste/icons/esm/DeleteIcon';
```

While this has more import lines than the previous example, we are specifying the import to a limited package. This keeps your bundles lean by only loading exactly what you need.

Paste Core is able to do this because Paste publishes each library and component as its own package. For example the above can be written as:

```jsx
import {Box} from '@twilio-paste/box';
import {Anchor} from '@twilio-paste/anchor';
import {Button} from '@tiwlio-paste/button';
import {Theme} from '@twilio-paste/theme';
// Paste Icons are not individually published
import {DisclosureIcon} from '@twilio-paste/icons/esm/DisclosureIcon';
import {DeleteIcon} from '@twilio-paste/icons/esm/DeleteIcon';
```

The reason we recommend Core over using individual package imports is because it makes maintaining Paste in your project easier. If using the above approach, your `package.json` file will be full of individual package dependencies
and keeping their versions in sync can be quite time consuming.

However, the individual package import is invaluable for when updating Core also makes changes to a package you aren't ready for. You can then install that pinned package and import from it directly.
For example let's assume we update our Core package and as a side effect, the Button component gets updated. We aren't ready to update Button, but that shouldn't stop us from updating the rest of Core! We can install `@twilio-paste/button` to the version that works and import it like this:

```jsx
import {Box} from '@twilio-paste/core/box';
import {Anchor} from '@twilio-paste/core/anchor';
import {Button} from '@tiwlio-paste/button'; // This loads the version we installed
import {Theme} from '@twilio-paste/core/theme';
```

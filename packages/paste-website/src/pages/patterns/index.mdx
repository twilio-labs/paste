## What is a pattern?

Patterns outline how to bring a collection of components together into a reusable solution that solves customer problems and delivers cohesion across our platforms. They are a set of guidelines around a particular user flow or interaction that designers and engineers should follow when creating customer experiences.

There are two primary goals of patterns:

- To drive efficiency across Twilio product teams by ensuring that no one needs to solve the same problem twice.
- To establish cohesion across the full Twilio platform so that users do not need to re-learn how to perform certain actions as they move from product to product.

## Patterns

<Tabs selectedId="available-patterns" baseId="patterns-tabs">
  <TabList aria-label="Pattern tabs">
    <Tab id="available-patterns">Available patterns</Tab>
    <Tab>Most requested patterns</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels paddingTop="space20">
    <TabPanel>
      <ComponentOverviewTable
        categoryRoute={SidebarCategoryRoutes.PATTERNS}
        componentsList={props.data.allAirtable.edges}
      />
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <Paragraph>
        These patterns have been highly requested by Twilio product designers and engineers and have been ranked based
        on customer impact, ease of work, and how frequently they appear on product UI roadmaps.

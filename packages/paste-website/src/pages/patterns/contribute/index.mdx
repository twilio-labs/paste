## Contribution at a glance

Anyone at Twilio can propose and incubate a new pattern or update an existing pattern,
though BU product designers are particularly well-equipped to do so given their proximity
to the customer problem that a given pattern is meant to solve.

Design Systems will partner with contributors to ensure the systemizability and accessibility
of a pattern, as well as on the documentation and creation of design assets (Sketch / Figma templates, etc).

## Deciding to contribute
If you are passionate about bringing cohesion to our product suite, contributing
to the pattern library is a great way to do that, no matter the size of the contribution.

A contribution could be anything from creating a full net-new pattern, to adding a new
variation of a pattern, to documenting an existing pattern that's already widely used.

While you'll likely need to set aside a little bit of extra time to contribute no matter
the scope of the work, our hope is that this contribution model is flexible enough to be
folded into your regular design process without adding much overhead (therefore making the
decision to contribute an easy one!).

If you see a [pattern on the list](/patterns#most-requested-patterns) that you're excited
about, or if you create an interaction or flow in your design work that you believe
could be used elsewhere in the products, that's a great opportunity to contribute to
the pattern library.

<Callout variant="info">
  <CalloutTitle>A contribution of any size is still a contribution!</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    We know the idea of contributing a pattern may seem daunting, but it doesn't have to be!
    Contributing a single variant of a larger pattern or documenting a pattern that
    already exists is a huge step towards bringing more efficiency to our work and more
    cohesion to our customer experiences.

## Creating a new pattern

### Kicking it off
1. When you have decided to contribute a pattern, reach out in `#help-design-system` and
let us know! We’ll work together to plan out the work, and we may be able to point you to any existing work on that pattern.
2. Reach out to your peers to collect any existing examples of the interaction or flow.
3. Draft a design spec ([here’s a template for ya](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SSIURVMzlGbANyvtYlU61ZdDaSqF2QigFdFZuSnYSkk/edit?usp=sharing))
to outline usage guidelines for the new pattern. This spec will eventually become the documentation for this pattern on the Paste docs site.
4. Create a shareable design asset or code sandbox for the new pattern for the purpose of collecting feedback.
5. Work with the Design Systems team to do an audit of the spec and design to ensure it is systemizable and accessible.
This can happen async as a Github Discussion or can happen during office hours.
6. After the audit, the pattern will be added to the Paste docs site and will be marked as an “[alpha](/patterns#available-patterns)”.

### Testing and collecting feedback
1. Share the alpha pattern in your regular feedback channels, such as your crit pods.
The alpha pattern will also be shared with the Design Systems committee for review.
2. The committee members will do a Risk Assessment Survey to determine the level of
user research the pattern requires.
   - If this pattern is being contributed as part of a larger product or feature, then
   this usability testing can be worked into the regular usability testing that would
   be done as part of the regular design process.
   - For a pattern that is already widely used, there may not be additional usability
   testing required.
3. Iterate on the pattern design and spec based on internal and user feedback.

### Finalizing a pattern
1. Finalize the designs and the design spec.
2. Partner with the Design Systems team to create any necessary assets and to finalize the docs page for the pattern.
3. The pattern will now move from the "[alpha](/patterns#available-patterns)" stage
to the "[beta](/patterns#available-patterns)" stage and can be used by other Twilio teams.
Patterns deemed low-risk by the committee may move directly from “[alpha](/patterns#available-patterns)” to
“[production](/patterns#available-patterns)”.
4. Announce the new pattern! Send a message in #team-ux, #help-design-system, and
your own BU's channel. The surface area at Twilio is large, and your new pattern can
help plenty of folks outside of just the product design team and Design Systems committee.

## Updating an existing pattern

When you want to make an update to an existing pattern (be it a beta pattern, or a production pattern),
you will follow many of the same steps as you would when contributing a new pattern, depending on the
degree of the change. Reach out to us in `#help-design-system` if you’d like to update an existing pattern,
and we can get the conversation started.

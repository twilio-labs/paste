## Access to Figma

As a Twilio Designer, you have access to Figma. Join the Twilio organization by requesting an
account through [ServiceNow](https://twilio.service-now.com/sp/). When you have access to Figma, you can learn more by reviewing our [Working with Figma guide](https://www.figma.com/file/WiJFrYa9YpIcFUmT06gTn0/Working-with-Figma).

## Using libraries

### How to turn on libraries

üëâ&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, you won‚Äôt have to worry too much about turning libraries on if you‚Äôre
joining an existing team. A "Team Owner" (or "Admin") should have already gone through
the steps of turning on default libraries (like the Paste and Console Navigation
libraries) with these steps: [setting up a Figma team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IOBY2kxdHB6b8nlSWIFOLK7TKTV-Xxv7czzCZIVTAxg/edit#heading=h.f209dtpr7col).

If you want to control libraries per file, go to the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù tab on a file. This is
also where you can drag in components to your file. Click the book icon in the upper
corner. From the modal, you can turn libraries on and off.

### Main libraries

The main libraries we recommend you have enabled for each file are:

- [Paste Components](https://www.figma.com/file/E6KUvMhioUmAgN0nwmReTM/Paste-Components)
- [Paste Default Theme](https://www.figma.com/file/OZKRQFOkOAl413m5JVIYE6/Paste-Default-Theme) includes tokens (color, text, and shadow styles), needed for the Paste components library
- [Paste Patterns](https://www.figma.com/file/S4z0Kqjb9AYosnkRQldLte/Paste-Patterns)
- [Brand Illustrations](https://www.figma.com/file/XeA9WNBcoojrdJbiz5Nj5q/Brand-Illustrations) includes illustrations for empty states, sections, etc
- [Asset Documentation](https://www.figma.com/file/GfY11A2VW638eFK48nDtdE/Asset-Documentation) includes helpful utilities for marking up designs, like sticky notes and cursors
- [File and Cover Sheet Template](https://www.figma.com/file/RfZYRjUH56rZ0qe0veqRJA/File-and-Cover-Sheet-Template)
- [Console Library](https://www.figma.com/file/vvdKgsO8OLcn7Q6FmuhWtl/Console-Library) for teams with Console projects **(managed by the Console team)**
- [SendGrid's legacy SG-DS](https://www.figma.com/file/YgSlHVVKgdCY2BzdTbHsPf/SG-DS) for teams with legacy SendGrid projects **(managed by the SendGrid team)**

Any time a library is updated, you‚Äôll get a notification in your project asking if you‚Äôd like to update.

---

## Using themes

Paste currently has [Default Theme](https://www.figma.com/file/OZKRQFOkOAl413m5JVIYE6/Paste-Default-Theme) and 
[Dark Theme](https://www.figma.com/file/TZMBaCxXkX8u5aVRVYboid/Paste-Dark-Theme?node-id=0%3A1) libraries.

When you have a theme library linked, you'll have access to:
- Text styles (font families, font weights, and font sizes)
- Colour styles (fill and stroke for background, border, and text colors)
- Effect styles (shadows, etc.)

![Menu in Figma when you can navigate through tokens for the Default theme](../../../assets/images/design-guidelines/token-styles.png)

You should be using components from Paste to compose your UIs whenever possible, but the text and layer styles will be helpful when you need to compose something more custom. 

This can be anything from setting a piece of text next to an icon to creating a custom stepper component.

---

## Using components
  
Components are UI elements that can be reused across your designs. They help you create and manage consistent designs across projects.

You can drag and drop components into your project via the Assets panel on the left, and swap to different variants for a given component via the Design panel on the right. 

Any layer with a ‚öôÔ∏è emoji indicates that there are nested variants available. 

Any layer with a ‚úèÔ∏è emoji indicates an editable layer. 

Check out our [tips and tricks](https://www.figma.com/file/E6KUvMhioUmAgN0nwmReTM/Paste-Components?node-id=284%3A1158) for more helpful hints about using the Paste Components library.

## Library updates

We release library updates continuously and use Figma‚Äôs version history to keep track.

We demarcate changes with hints which you can see in the description of each update:

- üöÄ&nbsp;&nbsp;**New**: [summary of a new thing]
- ‚ú®&nbsp;&nbsp;**Improved**: [summary of an improved thing]
- üêõ&nbsp;&nbsp;**Fixed**: [summary of a bug fix]
- ‚ùóÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;**Breaking**: [summary of a breaking change]

## Fonts

Fonts in Paste are preloaded into Figma so you don't need to download or install any font files.

### Inter

[Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) is a free Google font and our typeface for UI text.

### Fira Mono

[Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono?query=fira+mono) is a free Google font and our monospace typeface for code.

### SF Pro Text

[SF Pro Text](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) is the system font for Apple platforms. We represent native web element styles (like option lists in [Select](/components/select/)) in our design assets in macOS styles.

### Whitney
  
[Whitney](https://www.twilio.com/brand/elements/typography) is the Twilio brand typeface. Reach out to us in `#help-design-system` if you need access to the Whitney font files for work outside of Figma.

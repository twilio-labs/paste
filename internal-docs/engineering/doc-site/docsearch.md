# Docsearch

The search is provided by [Algolia Docsearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).

Docsearch scans the content of the website automatically, but can be configured via a config file that lives in the [Docsearch repository](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/6fdfca68e46dfbddacf5392a8b053479d95007b0/configs/twilio_paste.json). Information about modifying the Docsearch config can be found on their [documentation site](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/config-file). The login for Docsearch is stored in the team 1Password account.

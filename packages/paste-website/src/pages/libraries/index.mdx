All of these libraries are first-party; we actively support them and hope they provide you with as much value as they provide us.  


## Libraries


### [SVG-to-React](https://github.com/twilio-labs/svg-to-react)

SVG-to-React allows users to generate fully-formed and accessible React components from an SVG input.
The ouput will work similarly to the icons provided in Paste.  This library was created to allow for 
self-service when suggesting new Paste icons or when individual product needs differ from Paste.  For more 
information, see our [icon guidelines](/icon-system) and our [how-to docs](/icon-system/how-to-add-an-icon).


### [Sketch Twilio Ipsum](https://github.com/twilio-labs/sketch-twilio-ipsum/releases)

A [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) plugin to help populate mockups with "real" data. 
We believe there’s power in working with realistic and meaningful data as early as possible 
in the design process because:
- Content can inform design decisions and help you convey your purpose
- Real data can reveal edge cases in your work that would otherwise be caught during development
- It’s fun!

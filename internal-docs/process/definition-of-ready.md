# Definition of Ready

A Definition of Ready (DoR) is a team agreement of when an issue is ready to be included in the next sprint (sprint planning). You can view the DoR as the requirements the Product Owner (or team member who created the story) has to fulfill so that the Development Team accepts the story in the Sprint Planning meeting. It should also be STRONGLY considered when a story is created and made ready for backlog refinement â€” we want to respect everyone's time and optimize the refinement time by collecting all possible information/definition ahead of refinement. DoR is not an official "phase gate", but rather a guideline.

## Team Definition of Ready

1. UI Dev stories need to have design specs supplied
2. Support/rollout requirements should be listed
3. External Stakeholder Involvement should be listed
4. Dependencies of the work should be linked to the ticket
5. Story must be broken down enough to fit in a single sprint (for sprint planning)
6. To a reasonable extent, a story should be broken down so it doesn't feel like two stories
7. Have a clear understanding of which packages a story may touch
8. Story needs clear acceptance criterium and expected outcome listed
9. Clearly labeled design OR engineering ticket
10. All stories must be assigned to an Epic
11. All stories must be assigned to a Release when possible
12. Tickets have been labeled as paste-debt or paste-maintenance
    1. Debt = Any work on legacy systems and components (Style Guide, react-components, Console components Sketch libraries)
    2. Maintenance = Any work on existing Paste components

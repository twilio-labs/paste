## üì£ What's new in Paste

### Chat Log animations

<Box as={Image} maxWidth="size60" src={ChatLog} alt="" style={{objectFit: 'contain'}} />

The final piece of [the Chat Log package](/components/chat-log) is complete‚Äî animation! There is a new useChatLogger hook that manages a list of messages, bookends, and events and a new ChatLogger component that animates the list into a Chat Log.

</Paragraph>

### In Page Navigation

<Box as={Image} maxWidth="size60" src={PageNav} alt="" style={{objectFit: 'contain'}} />

The In Page Navigation component is a collection of links that navigate users to related pages. Although stylistically similar to Tabs, this component‚Äôs structure allows for straightforward integration with routers like React Router.

</Paragraph>

### Chat Composer

<Box as={Image} maxWidth="size60" src={ChatComposer} alt="" style={{objectFit: 'contain'}} />

A highly anticipated component, the Chat Composer is a rich text input that users can type chat messages into. It is built with [the Lexical text editor](https://lexical.dev/) and can be extended to include the features you need through Lexical‚Äôs plugins.

### Display Heading

<ResponsiveImage src={DisplayHeading} />

Many marketing pages use large text to call attention to information or express their brand. Display Heading is a new component that is meant to be used for large text that does not provide any hierarchical structure to the page.

### Additional updates

#### New

- Paste now uses Twilio Sans Mono for monospace text! Check it out in the [Inline Code](/components/inline-code) and [Code Block](/components/code-block) components.
- [Localization documentation](/foundations/localization) has been updated with info on how to internationalize Paste components.
- [Word list](/foundations/content/word-list) provides guidance on how, when, and whether to use specific words, as well as guidance on capitalization for product-specific terms. Reach out to **Megan Allison** and **Aren Goetcherian** to learn more.
- New components in Figma
  - [Date Picker](https://www.figma.com/file/E6KUvMhioUmAgN0nwmReTM/Paste-Components?node-id=19925%3A139727&t=2InhUyZENIDeic72-4)
  - [Time Picker](https://www.figma.com/file/E6KUvMhioUmAgN0nwmReTM/Paste-Components?node-id=19929%3A173093&t=2InhUyZENIDeic72-4)

#### Improvements

- [Switch](/components/switch): updated the API to match checkbox
- [Combobox](/components/combobox/): improved the types for the single and multi select combobox components (thanks **David Synnott** and **Sam Johnson** for finding these issues!)

## ‚ú® Pastemates‚Ñ¢ spotlight

<em>
  Pastemates are individuals and teams who have been critical contributors to Paste, through advocating for adoption
  within their products and channeling important feedback and contributions back into the system.

<ResponsiveImage src={Justin} />

In this edition of Pastemates, we're spotlighting a mate from Twilio Contact Center Sales, Justin Young! Justin has been busy emboldening the Twilio Builder Spirit, stitching together the new Flex UI and its inbuilt support of Paste, with builder.io, to create a drag and drop Flex UI builder!

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '55.26590198123045%', height: 0}}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/8162c351e3524b818b29697a5736ca54"
    frameborder="0"
    webkitallowfullscreen
    mozallowfullscreen
    allowfullscreen
    style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
  ></iframe>
</div>

<Box marginBottom="space70" />

Justin registered Paste React components to Builder.io which allows Justin and his team to rapidly create rich Paste-based experiences in the Flex UI using a drag and drop editor. By exposing paste component properties like variants in the Builder.io editor, Justin can choose between different styles of buttons, alerts and any other Paste component that they have wired up. As you can see by the video demo's the authoring is easy and intuitive and the customer experiences and functionality it creates are excellent and fully functional. Another benefit to his team is that they can begin to build complex components using many different Paste components, and save them as templates for easy re-use in customer demos.

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '55.26590198123045%', height: 0}}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/2c3b6d26919749738aa47ff11d48fcd4"
    frameborder="0"
    webkitallowfullscreen
    mozallowfullscreen
    allowfullscreen
    style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
  ></iframe>
</div>

<Box marginBottom="space70" />

In Justin‚Äôs own words:

<Blockquote>
  I am no designer, but this is already better than every flex demo we‚Äôve ever built from a UX perspective because of
  access to paste
</Blockquote>

We're stoked that Justin and team were able to create this builder experience all on their own, just by the Flex and Paste teams collaborating together! We can't wait to see what other people build next, with Paste on top of Flex.

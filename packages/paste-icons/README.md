## FAQ

### Are these components as render performant as images?

[Yes!](https://github.com/TheSisb/svg-stress-test) The difference is negligable in both dev and prod. Worth it, if you consider the accessibility and usability gains.

### Why are we switching from icon fonts?

Icon fonts were a novel and useful solution for a bygone era of front-end development. [Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons.](https://github.com/twilio-labs/svg-to-react/blob/master/RATIONALE.md)

### How can I animate these icons?

Wrap these icons with a component that animates its children or pass in a className prop. See the [Spinner component](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/blob/main/packages/paste-core/components/spinner/src/index.tsx) for an example.

### Can I modify the template that generates these icon components?

Yes! The tooling that powers this is [seperately bundled and available for use.](https://github.com/twilio-labs/svg-to-react)

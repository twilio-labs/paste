## üì£ What's new in Paste

### 100% of Paste components updated to the new design language

<ResponsiveImage src={DesignLanguageImage} alt="" />

We are excited to announce that the new One Twilio Design Language is fully live!

This update comes from an initiative to create a cohesive design language to unify Twilio‚Äôs product suite. Learn more about the work on the Twilio Blog: ["Bringing Cohesion to the Twilio Product Suite"](https://www.twilio.com/blog/bringing-cohesion-to-the-twilio-product-suite-part-i)

<Box
  borderColor="colorBorderWeaker"
  borderStyle="solid"
  borderWidth="borderWidth10"
  borderRadius="borderRadius20"
  marginBottom="space120"
>
  <Box as={Image} maxWidth="100%" src={ThemeSwitcherImage} alt="" style={{objectFit: 'contain'}} />
</Box>

The update can be seen now on the Paste site. This update comes through 3 new themes: **twilio, twilio-dark, and evergreen**. For details on each theme, visit our [theme documentation](https://paste.twilio.design/theme).

To determine a timeline for upgrading to the new design language in your product, check out our [recommended process](https://www.figma.com/proto/wAXdm0CAM3rnjn3RJsWb2v/One-Twilio-Updates-Shareout-for-Team-UX?node-id=1-17899&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1) and [suggested timeline strategy](https://www.figma.com/proto/wAXdm0CAM3rnjn3RJsWb2v/One-Twilio-Updates-Shareout-for-Team-UX?node-id=154-164616&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1). We recommend most product teams migrate their top and side navigation bars to use Paste Navigation UI Kit components (estimated for Q2 release) before swapping from their existing theme to the `twilio` theme (recommend Q3‚ÄìQ4).

Look for even more details about this design language update and the **Tess Hannel** for her leadership on this project with the Paste team üåü.

[**Check out the new design language on display**](/)

### [Typography Guidelines](/foundations/typography)

<ResponsiveImage src={TypographyImage} alt="" />

Our newest [foundations page on Typography](/foundations/typography) shares guidelines on how to set type in Twilio products, using our new design language and typefaces, Twilio Sans Display, Twilio Sans Text, and Twilio Sans Mono. If you‚Äôre looking for help in making a decision on how to use a near-infinite combination of font families, sizes, colors, weights, line-heights, and more, and make sure all those text combinations work together on a page, these guidelines are for you!

### [Detail Text Component](/components/detail-text)

<ResponsiveImage src={DetailTextImage} alt="" />

The [Detail Text](/components/detail-text) component is used for small pieces of text that are secondary to body text in a page. Use it for an image caption, in a chart legend, or as a paragraph footnote.

### Additional updates

#### New

- Added [68 new icons](/components/icons) to support: Segment, Rich-text editing, Aion (TimeIcon), Console (TrendUpIcon, TrendDownIcon, ProductVoiceIntelligenceIcon), and Twilio customer requests (StoreIcon). Thanks, **Emma Sims** and **Colleen Yerkes** for their collaboration and reviews on these!

#### Improvements

- [Popover](/components/popover): Updated with more detailed documentation and examples based on feedback from the Design Systems Committee. Thanks, all!
- [Toast](/components/toast#reponsive-toast): Added a `left` prop to make Toasts more mobile-compatible. Thanks for the suggestion, **Claudia Zhou**!
- [Side Modal](/components/side-modal): Increased the default width of Side Modal to better align with Segment use cases and content. Thanks for the suggestion, **Darci Meachin and Chris Chan**! Side Modal also received a little TLC with a new animation ‚ú®.

## üö¶ Q1 OKR results

**Objective:** Establish Paste as the standard UI framework for Segment, and unify Twilio customer experiences in a single, beautiful Design Language update.

In this edition of Pastemates, we're spotlighting a mate from Twilio‚Äôs Data & Applications BU, Colleen Yerkes! Colleen‚Äôs been instrumental in advocating for Paste within SendGrid Marketing Campaigns.

Despite her product team‚Äôs tight timeline and unique use case within Twilio‚Äôs product suite, Colleen has been highly adaptable in her collaboration, leveraging office hours, GitHub Discussions, and our dependency tracker in the best ways depending on the type of questions that came up as design and development progressed. Colleen‚Äôs leadership in this work and thoughtful questions have pushed our design system and team to more deeply consider how components and layouts provided through Paste can be used throughout canvas-based customer experiences.

## Why are we building Paste?

A common question we get is: why build a design system at Twilio? Here are some of the reasons why we&rsquo;re investing in a common UX platform for our customers:

### Accessibility at Twilio scale

One of the core components of Twilio Magic is to Be Inclusive. Designing and building experiences that are accessible to a diverse set of users is an important part of this goal, but unfortunately requires a great deal of time and subject matter expertise. Teams that use Paste get accessibility best practices built in, so that they can focus on the customer problem without sacrificing inclusion.

### Bring cohesion to our diverse suite of products

Great UX is important, and equally so is the unified application of it. Twilio customers use different products for different needs. By using Paste components and guidelines that are aligned to Twilio UX’s best practice, teams can swiftly build products that customers don’t have to relearn constantly. And for specific customer needs, Paste also allows for thoughtful deviation via custom implementations to truly delight users.

### Get better at scale and optimize for efficiency that counts

By providing all teams with a shared set of composable tokens, components, and patterns to pull from, Paste helps teams design and build faster, and makes future UI upgrades simple. This allows us to keep our product quality bar high without sacrificing speed. This also allows for efficient reuse of features and designs across a customer’s journey by enabling UI reuse across different products and workflows.

### Instill trust and confidence

Paste is designed to mature our UI interfaces and improve reuse, resiliency, and upgrades at scale. By using Paste, we can create interfaces that inspire customer trust by shipping product UI updates with zero negative impact to the end customer. Our technology choices mean our components are encapsulated but extensible, enabling versioned design updates.

## Paste is...

- **Accessible by default.** As a principle, the design systems team does not ship a component, primitive, or composition if it does not meet or surpass our target of WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance. This means that as a consuming team, you can expect a lot of the heavy lifting required to build accessible products to be done by Paste. However, you must still think about, and regularly audit your product for accessibility. The Design Systems team can support you on this work.
- **Composable by design.** Paste tokens, primitives, components, and compositions themselves are inherently composable. This means, in the simplest of terms, that you can use small or large pieces interchangably to solve your product / UI problems.

## Paste is not...

- **Concerned with application logic.** All Paste components are presentational, and have no opinions on the way data is passed to them.
- **Stateful.** While components have encapsulated internal state when necessary (e.g.UI behavior or keyboard interaction), the components themselves are not concerned with application state.
- **Product or domain specific.** Paste components aim to serve all UI needs semantically, and Paste compositions aim to serve Twilio pattern needs at the most generic level. We believe that a good design system raises the floor of great customer experience, and are excited to see thoughtful, well-researched ejections from the system that raise the ceiling.

## Inspired by...

Paste takes a lot of its inspiration from the fantastic folks that have done this before us. We seek diverse opinions in designing our solutions for our customers. We can&rsquo;t build Paste without the ideas and tools proposed by:

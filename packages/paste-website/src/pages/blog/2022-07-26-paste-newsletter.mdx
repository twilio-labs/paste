## üì£ What's new in Paste

### The new tokens page is live!

![](/images/tokens-page.gif)

We are extremely excited to announce that we have released a new version of the tokens list page! It has a streamlined and improved design with the ability to search through token names and values, quick copy buttons for each token, and switch between JavaScript and CSS formats. You can also watch our [walkthrough of the new features](https://www.loom.com/share/6ac6db3e5120442293c7d151d454f272).

We hope that you find the new tokens page easier to use. Please [send us any feedback and suggestions](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/discussions) about how we can continue making our site work better for you.

### Figma Slot components

![](../../assets/images/articles/2022-07-26-paste-newsletter/figma-slots.png)

On July 28th, there was a big Figma release that introduced the concept of Slots. Slots are placeholder components that can be nested inside container components. They‚Äôre intentionally empty so that you can swap them out for your own custom content. It‚Äôs now easier for you to place custom content inside of existing Paste container components (e.g. Card, Modal, Disclosure, etc.) without having to detach them! It‚Äôs as easy as swapping out variants.

### New Chat Log documentation

![](../../assets/images/articles/2022-07-26-paste-newsletter/chat-log-example.png)

We‚Äôve been quietly releasing components in the Chat Log package for the Conversations UI Kit and they‚Äôre finally ready for the big time! More components and documentation are coming next release, so watch this space!

![](../../assets/images/articles/2022-07-26-paste-newsletter/form-pill-example.png)

Form Pill Group has new and improved styles for each state. We‚Äôve introduced a new error variant, added support for disabled Form Pills, and updated the documentation page to share how to use them in Figma along with more examples of the states.

## ‚ú® Pastemates‚Ñ¢ spotlight

<em>
  Pastemates are individuals and teams who have been critical contributors to Paste, through advocating for adoption
  within their products and channeling important feedback and contributions back into the system.
</em>

![](../../assets/images/articles/2022-07-26-paste-newsletter/andy-doyle.png)

Our August Pastemate is none other than the original Paste prototyping pioneer, Andy Doyle. Andy is a Product Designer on the Billing team, based in Ireland. Upon joining Twilio, Andy jumped right into the Paste world and asked how he might go about [Designing in the Browser](https://csswizardry.com/2010/10/designing-in-the-browser-leads-to-better-quality-builds/). Andy‚Äôs comfort and experience with web-based technologies has led him to participate in the research and testing of [the Paste Prototyping Kit](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste-prototype-kit) and is still one of the most active users. When asked about why he loves prototyping his design ideas he said:

<Box marginBottom="space70" fontSize="fontSize40" lineHeight="lineHeight40" color="colorTextWeak">
  <em>
    I love building prototypes that are as close to the real thing so I can see how my designs adapt at different screen
    sizes and how our customers interact with something that feels real. It‚Äôs never been easier to create web based
    prototypes with CSS Grid and Flexbox (and Paste{' '}
  </em>
  üòâ<em>)!</em>
</Box>

Andy has also been heavily involved in helping the UX Infrastructure team develop and conduct a [‚ÄúPrototyping with Codesandbox‚Äù](https://www.figma.com/proto/zelCFduQmmQnoSavV6FtCc/Prototyping-with-CodeSandbox---UX-Showcase?node-id=2%3A6&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1) workshop series, aimed at teaching folks how to use Paste to prototype and validate product ideas with customers quickly, with realistic interactive prototypes. Better yet, the code is directly transferable to production environments, empowering our team of builders to get their ideas to market quickly.

Andy‚Äôs contributions have not only influenced greater (and easier) prototyping, but have also demonstrated how to establish stronger partnerships between engineers and product designers. Which in turn, have helped facilitate better hand-offs and product development discussions.

## üî¨ Paste by numbers

Did you know that we have data on Paste usage? We track:

- \# of repositories that import Paste packages
- Which components are used in code
- What props people use on each component

Since January 1, 2022, of the repositories using 300 or more components:

- **Console** has gone from using **18,378** components to **30,778**! This is a **67% increase** in total usage.

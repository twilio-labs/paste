        "# Page interaction on click for pagination - Answer\nHi @tonge495 \n\nI don't think we have a particular preference, it's largely based on user expectations based on what you're actually doing, aligning to default browser behaviours.\n\nThere are largely two approaches:\n\n1) Each page in the pagination takes the user to a new route/url. When visiting that route the table of results will always be the same. That way you can share your search query and results (Preferred). In this case the action is a page navigation, just like navigating to any other page, and should act accordingly. This usually takes a user to the very top of the page.\n\n2) Each page in the pagination just re-renders the table above. No route change. In this case you must manually place the user above the table of results to inform them that something on the page has happened. \n\nIn both cases, whether you jump or soft scroll to the new location is up to you, and potentially what action is being taken in the browser, will dictate what you _can_ do.\n\nHope that helps a little.",

The A2P homepage currently uses buttons with link functionality and I just want to make sure we are utilizing them in the correct way.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for all your help! ',

        '# No vertical in-page navigation\nHello team, \r\n\r\nPer paste guidance we should be using in-page navigation instead of tabs if we are navigating user to a different URL per tab. \r\nFor Segment-> Unify settings we need both a horizontal in-page navigation and a vertical in-page navigation. However it seems like we don\'t have a vertical in-page navigation per my ENG team\'s investigation. Could you confirm if that\'s true?\r\n\r\nIf that\'s the case, should we use vertical tabs instead or use 2 horizontal in-page navigation?

        We&rsquo;re excited to release Dark theme in Paste! We&rsquo;ve done this work in partnership with{' '}

          Flex

        Why did we make a Dark theme?
      </Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Because Dark theme unlocks dark mode for our UIs, and dark mode is cool! Additionally, dark mode reduces eye
        strain and improves readability for many people. Giving our users the ability to use Twilio products in dark
        mode is key to building lovable products that support each of our users.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        And with Paste&rsquo;s Dark theme, it&rsquo;s simple to enable dark mode in your products if your UIs are built
        completely with Paste.
      </Paragraph>
      <Heading variant="heading30" as="h2">
        But wait, what&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;dark mode&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dark theme&rdquo; in Paste?
      </Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        We&rsquo;re so glad you asked! Light/dark mode is a user preference that can be set at the operating system,
        browser, or application level, and which we can honor in our UIs. In both light and dark mode, you get to choose
        what Paste theme is used for the UI. Paste&rsquo;s Dark theme allows you, our consumers, to enable light/dark
        mode in your products with ease.
      </Paragraph>
      <Heading variant="heading30" as="h2">
        When can I start using Dark theme?
      </Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        You can start using the Dark theme today, as long as your UIs are built fully with Paste and the Default theme.
        You should not use the Dark theme if there are any surface areas within your product that aren&rsquo;t using
        Paste.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        As an example, if you have built a form but are using a multi-select dropdown from another library, when you
        switch into dark mode, that one component will remain light and look very much out of place.

      <Heading variant="heading30" as="h2">
        How can I start using Dark theme?

        Using the Dark theme should be a{' '}

        , and swap your screens from the &ldquo;Paste Default Theme&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Paste Dark Theme&rdquo;.
        We&rsquo;ve tested it out a bit on our side, and it works great as long as every part of your UI (even the white
        background fill on your frames) is referencing tokens from the &ldquo;Paste Default Theme&rdquo; library in
        Figma. The library swap won&rsquo;t work for raw hex codes, because Figma won&rsquo;t know what to swap them to.

        Where can I see the Dark theme in action?

      <Paragraph>
        Currently, you can see Dark theme in the Paste documentation site, Flex UI 2.0, and the new Billing interface,
        Billio.

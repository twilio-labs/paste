## Guidelines

### Why do we need unique IDs

Unique IDs are important because:

- The [HTML spec says they should be unique](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-id-attribute) and strange bugs might occur otherwise.
- You need them to correctly pair form elements together for better UX.
- You need them to provide additional information for screenreaders, such as to provide a text hint to icons.

Here's what could happen without unique IDs:

<iframe

  style="width:100%; height:310px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="blue-http-xqqo4"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

### Why do we need a library?

Anytime a software product needs unique identifiers, the likelyhood of `id` collisions increases the larger the project and team becomes.
Furthermore, the way React has transformed the traditional process of page-based development to componened-based development leads to more situations where an `id` can clash.
For example, if one page renders the same `DeleteIcon` component twice and that icon has `id="delete-icon"` hardcoded, then we now have an `id` collision.
It is very difficult to predict the exact circumstances where a component will be used, so any time a component needs an `id` the risk of a collision is present.

### How does this library work?

This library maintains a sequential count, so that everytime a component mounts and needs an ID, it will fetch the next value (`count += 1`).

## Usage Guide

This package is a wrapper around [react-uid](https://github.com/thearnica/react-uid).
If you’re wondering why we wrapped that package into our own, we reasoned that
it would be best for our consumers’ developer experience. For example:

- We can control which APIs we expose and how to expose them. For example, in this package
  export only some of the source package's exports.
- If we want to migrate the underlying nuts and bolts in the future, Twilio products that
  depend on this primitive would need to replace all occurrences of `import … from ‘@react-uid’`
  to `import … from ‘@some-new/package’`. By wrapping it in `@twilio-paste/uid-library`,
  this refactor can be avoided. The only change would be a version bump in the package.json file.
- We can more strictly enforce semver and backwards compatibility than some of our dependencies.
- We can control when to provide an update and which versions we allow, to help reduce
  potential bugs our consumers may face.

This package has 4 exports, described below.

### API

#### useUID()

This is a React Hook to generate a UID.

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/happy-bush-ued0c?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style="width:100%; height:310px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="useUID example"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

<Box marginTop="space100" />

#### useUIDSeed()

This React Hook creates a seed from which you can generate several UIDs. It's handy for when you need multiple `id`s in a single component.

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/useuidseed-example-p0sxb?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style="width:100%; height:310px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="useUIDSeed example"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

<Box marginTop="space100" />

#### UIDFork Component

<Callout>
  <CalloutText>This is only needed for lazy-loaded or code-split chunks.</CalloutText>
</Callout>

This React Component pivots the global singleton `count` to read a counter from React Context.
If your app has code-splitting or lazy-loading, you want to wrap every entrypoint with `<UIDFork>` in order
to garantee there isn't any collisions.

<Box marginTop="space100" />

#### uid(item, index)

<Callout variant="warning">
  <CalloutTitle>Don't use this API in React Components</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    Prefer using the other React Hooks (useUID or useUIDSeed) in React components. They are Server Side Rendering (SSR)
    compatible and the recommended future-proof API.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

A plain Javascript function to return a UID. `item` should be an object (in JS, this could mean a function, an array, etc.). If `item` isn't an object
, provide the second argument `index`. This API is not SSR friendly.

We provide this export for quick UID generation in utility files.

  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="uid Example"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"

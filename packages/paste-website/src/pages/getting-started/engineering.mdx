import DogVideo from "../../assets/quickstart_alpha.mp4"


## Installation

Currently, every package is standalone in the paste project.  While this means you only get what you need, it makes it a little more tedious to get started.  We hope to address this in the near future, but for now you can run:

#### External dependencies

```shell
yarn add @emotion/core @emotion/styled styled-system@4.1.0 react-uid
```

#### System packages

```shell
yarn add @twilio-paste/theme @twilio-paste/design-tokens @twilio-paste/theme-tokens @twilio-paste/box @twilio-paste/icons @twilio-paste/spinner @twilio-paste/text @twilio-paste/button @twilio-paste/anchor @twilio-paste/absolute @twilio-paste/screen-reader-only @twilio-paste/media-object
```


## 8 minute video walkthrough

Be gentle :P  - this was recorded in one take on zoom.

<video controls width="640px" height="480px">
    <source src={DogVideo} type="video/mp4" />
</video>


## Usage

```jsx
import {Theme} from '@twilio-paste/theme';

// Wrap your root component with the Theme.Provider like so:
<Theme.Provider theme="default">
    // other stuff here
</Theme.Provider>
```

Now you can use our themed and tokenized components anywhere in your app:

```jsx
import {Box} from '@twilio-paste/box';

<Box margin="space20" backgroundColor="colorBackground">
    Hello Paste!
</Box>
```

Our tokens are readily available on our components and typescript typings are provided.

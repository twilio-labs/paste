## Guidelines

### About Cards

Cards are specifically-styled containers that group relatable content and actions. Card is an extremely
flexible container that does not require specific components inside of it. You can compose a Card to support your use case,
but elements such as [Heading](/components/heading), [Paragraph](/components/paragraph), and [Button](/components/button) or [Anchor](/components/anchor) are commonly used.
See [When to use a Card](#when-to-use-a-card) and [Examples](#examples) for common Card patterns and dos/donts.

A Card does not handle any interactive events such as hover, click, or focus, though children
composed inside of it may commonly have event handlers.

Acknowledging the flexibility of Card component, there are several [non-negotiable properties](#anatomy)
of a Card that differentiate it from a more basic page-layout element, such as [Box](/primitives/box) including background color, border width, border radius, and border color.

### Card vs. Box

At its core, Card is a [Box](/primitives/box) with specific styling attributes and more explicit use cases that you can find in [Examples](#examples).
If you find yourself limited by the default styling and constraints of a Card, you may consider using a Box instead,
but first consider bringing the problem you are trying to solve
to Design System Office Hours to see if another component or pattern could fit your needs.

### Examples

#### Basic Card

An example of a Card with default padding.

<LivePreview scope={{Card, Paragraph, Heading, Anchor}} language="jsx">
  {`<Card>
  <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">Parable of the Talents</Heading>
  <Paragraph>
    Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought. To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears. To be led by a fool is to be led
    by the opportunists who control the fool. To be led by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen. To be led by a liar is to ask to be
    lied to. To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph marginBottom="space0">— <Anchor href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60932.Parable_of_the_Talents">Octavia Butler</Anchor></Paragraph>
</Card>`}
</LivePreview>

#### Card with Title, Body and Button

One of the most common use cases for a Card is to relate a title ([Heading](/components/heading)), supporting body copy ([Paragraph](/components/paragraph)),
and primary action ([Button](/components/button)) together. Relating these three elements together with a Card makes it easy for a user to
digest and provides a clear call to action. Padding surrounding the inner content of a Card can be
adjusted to suit the needs of your implementation.

<LivePreview scope={{Stack, Card, Paragraph, Heading, Button}} language="jsx">
  {`<Stack orientation="vertical" spacing="space40">
    <Card padding="space120">
      <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">The Transgender District</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        The mission of the Transgender District is to create an urban environment that fosters the rich history, culture, legacy, and empowerment of transgender
        people and its deep roots in the southeastern Tenderloin neighborhood. The transgender district aims to stabilize and economically empower the transgender
        community through ownership of homes, businesses, historic and cultural sites, and safe community spaces.
      </Paragraph>
      <Button variant="primary" as="a" href="https://www.transgenderdistrictsf.com/">Support The Transgender District</Button>
    </Card>
    <Card padding="space120">
      <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">Inside Out</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Inside Out empowers, educates, and advocates for LGBTQ+ of youth from the Pikes Peak Region in Southern Colorado. Inside Out does this by creating safe spaces,
        support systems and teaching life skills to all youth in the community and working to make the community safer and more accepting of gender and sexual orientation
        diversity.
      </Paragraph>
      <Button variant="primary" as="a" href="https://insideoutys.org/">Support Inside Out</Button>
    </Card>
    <Card padding="space120">
      <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">The Audre Lorde Project</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        The Audre Lorde Project is a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Two Spirit, Trans and Gender Non Conforming People of Color center for community organizing, focusing on
        the New York City area. Through mobilization, education and capacity-building, they work for community wellness and progressive social and economic justice. Committed
        to struggling across differences, they seek to responsibly reflect, represent and serve their various communities.
      </Paragraph>
      <Button variant="primary" as="a" href="https://alp.org/">Support The Audre Lorde Project</Button>
    </Card>
  </Stack>`}
</LivePreview>

#### Card with Centered Content

Your implementation use case may call for a Card with centered content. You can accommodate this by
using the alignment props available on some components, or by creating a custom layout inside your
Card using Box or Flex.

<LivePreview scope={{Card, Paragraph, Anchor, Text}} language="jsx">
  {`<Card padding="space200">
  <Text as="div" textAlign="center">
    <Paragraph>
      We want a world where boys can feel, girls can lead, and the rest of us can not only exist but thrive. This is not
      about erasing men and women but rather acknowledging that man and woman are two of many—stars in a constellation that
      do not compete but amplify one another’s shine.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph marginBottom="space0">— <Anchor href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51794301-beyond-the-gender-binary">Alok Vaid-Menon</Anchor></Paragraph>
  </Text>
</Card>;`}
</LivePreview>

## Composing a Card

### When to use a Card

Cards are a great tool for relating a concise amount of related information together in one object, much like a business card or baseball card in real life.

For example, you might use a single Card as a summary for a feature whose call to action encourages a user to dive deeper. Alternatively, multiple Cards on a single page with hierarchy of equal weights could be used to highlight multiple choices or paths a user can take.

Ultimately, Card is a very flexible component that can fit a variety of needs. If you feel that you have a unique use case or are limited by the Card implementation, please visit Design System Office Hours to see how we can help address your needs.

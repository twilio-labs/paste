# File Picker

## To do

- Fix type (ts error on `accept` prop)
- Fix SiblingBox to properly set focus styles
- Docs
- Tests

## Notes for docs

- `accept` prop - doesn't necessarily validate or block types, just allows the browser to suggest specific types https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept. Note: consumers should implement server-side validation
- always use label with file picker, same guidance as input

## Open questions

- What should be `element="FILEPICKER"`?

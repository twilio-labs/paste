  Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store
  visual design attributes.
</Blockquote>

Tokens are named for their use case, rather than their value. For example
`$color-background-error` is named to indicate the appropriate background
color for an error, as opposed to `$color-background-red` which is less
specific and could be used in a number of ways depending on cultural context
and design language. This makes their intended use clear and intentional,
and allows us to develop a scalable and consistent visual language.

In Paste, **1 rem unit = 16 pixels**.

  ## Upcoming Release

  Paste's upcoming release will be on **April 7, 2020**. This is what we've planned:

  - Form components are the bread and butter for most Twilio experiences. With this release we'll ship two components (Text Input, and Textarea) for Sketch and React. 📝 

  - We'll ship a Content guide for Twilio UX, which should help you to feel more confident in writing concise, clear, and consistent product content. 🖊 

  - Modals, an important container element to focus user attention, will be shipped for Sketch and React. 🔳

  ## Future Releases

  Future releases of Paste are scheduled for every six weeks, with the next release on **May 19, 2020**. Our guidance on what's planned will update as we get closer to the date. For now, here's what we're hoping to do:

  - More Form components (Select, Checkbox, Checkbox Group, Radio, and Radio Group)
  - Ship a Form composition component. 📝
  - Ship a Toast component. 🍞
  - Add an icon list to the [icon system guidelines](/icon-system) with more design guidelines. 👩🏽‍🎤

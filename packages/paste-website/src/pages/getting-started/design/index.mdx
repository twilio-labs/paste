## Installation

You’ll need to download a few things before you can get started using Paste in
your design work.

### Abstract

All product designers across Twilio use Abstract to host and version control
their design files. We also use Abstract to link Paste Sketch libraries and
manage library updates (more on that later). Connect with your design manager
to get added to the Twilio team in Abstract.

<Callout variant="information">
  <CalloutTitle>
    Getting familiar with Abstract
  </CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    If you are not yet familiar with Abstract, please take some time to learn
    about <Anchor href="https://www.abstract.com/how-it-works">how it works</Anchor>,
    and read through these resources
    on <Anchor href="https://help.abstract.com/best-practices/">best practices</Anchor>.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

### Sketch

Product designers across Twilio use Sketch to design their UIs. You
can <Anchor href="https://twilio.service-now.com/sp/">file a ticket with IT</Anchor> to
get a Sketch license. In the meantime, you
can <Anchor href="https://www.sketch.com/try/">download the free trial</Anchor>
on your work laptop to get you up and running.

### Font files

#### Inter

If you are using the Default theme in Paste, you will need
to <Anchor href="https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/download/v3.15/Inter-3.15.zip">download Inter.</Anchor>
It’s a free font. After you download the files, follow the instructions in the
“install-mac.txt” file in your download. We recommend following the steps using Font Book.

#### Fira Mono

If you are using any theme in Paste, you will need
to <Anchor href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono?query=fira+mono">download Fira Mono</Anchor>,
our monospace typeface for code. It’s a free Google font.

#### SF Pro
If you are using any theme in Paste, you will need to <Anchor href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">download SF Pro</Anchor>, the
system font for Apple platforms. We represent native web element styles (like option lists in <Anchor href="/form-elements/select/">Select</Anchor>) in
our design assets as macOS styles.

#### Whitney

If you are using the Console theme in Paste, you will need to download Whitney.
Reach out to us in `#help-design-system` if you need access to the Whitney font
files for your work.

## How to use Sketch libraries

For every Abstract project that you work on where you plan on using Paste, you
will need to link the necessary Paste Sketch libraries in order to use the
Sketch symbols, text styles, and layer styles.

<Callout variant="information">
  <CalloutTitle>
    Tips on linking libraries in Abstract
  </CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    If you haven’t linked libraries in Abstract before,
    follow <Anchor href="https://help.abstract.com/libraries/link-libraries/">this guide</Anchor> to learn how.

### Paste design tokens

<Flex>
  <Tooltip text="There is ongoing maintenance and net new work in this project. Libraries in this project are at parity with code.">
    <Anchor><SuccessIcon decorative={false} title="Success icon" color="colorTextSuccess"/></Anchor>
  </Tooltip>
  <Text as="p" marginBottom="space50" marginLeft="space20">
    Libraries in this project are actively maintained
  </Text>
</Flex>

The <strong>Paste design tokens</strong> project houses the text and layer styles
for each theme in Paste. These libraries represent
the <Anchor href="/tokens">tokens</Anchor> available for use in the system. For
example, in the <strong>default theme</strong> file, you can find layer styles
for every background color token that is available for the Default theme.

#### Linking the library

There are two libraries available in this project: <strong>console theme</strong> (this is the current
theme you see in Console) and <strong>default theme</strong> (this is the new unified theme, formerly known as UDL.

Link whichever library matches the theme you are using in your project. For example, if you are designing using the
Default theme, link the default theme library to your project.

<Callout variant="warning">
  <CalloutTitle>
    A note on the SendGrid theme
  </CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    You will also see the <strong>sendgrid theme</strong> in this project, but this theme is not actively maintained due to low usage.
    If you plan to use this theme, please reach out to us in #help-design-system.

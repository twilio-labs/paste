## Installation

You‚Äôll need to download a few things before you can get started designing UIs with Paste.

### Font files

#### Fira Mono

If you are using <strong>any theme</strong> in Paste, you will need
to [download and install Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono?query=fira+mono),
our monospace typeface for code. It‚Äôs a free Google font.

#### SF Pro

If you are using <strong>any theme</strong> in Paste, you will need to [download and install SF Pro](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/), the
system font for Apple platforms. We represent native web element styles (like option lists in [Select](/components/select/)) in
our design assets in the macOS styles.

#### Inter

If you are using the <strong>Default theme</strong> in Paste, you will need
to [download and install Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/download/v3.15/Inter-3.15.zip), which we use for UI text.
It‚Äôs a free font. After you download the files, follow the instructions in the
`install-mac.txt` file in your download. We recommend following the steps using Font Book.

#### Whitney

If you are using the <strong>Console theme</strong> in Paste, you will need to download Whitney, which we use for UI text.
Reach out to us in `#help-design-system` if you need access to the Whitney font files for your work.

### Figma

As a Twilio Designer you have access to Figma. Join the Twilio organization by requesting an
account through [ServiceNow](https://twilio.service-now.com/sp/). To learn more,
review our [working with Figma guide](https://www.figma.com/file/WiJFrYa9YpIcFUmT06gTn0/Working-with-Figma).

#### How to turn on libraries

üëâ&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, you won‚Äôt have to worry too much about turning libraries on if you‚Äôre
joining an existing team. A "Team Owner" (or "Admin") should have already gone through
the steps of turning on default libraries (like the Paste and Console Navigation
libraries) with these steps: [setting up a Figma team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IOBY2kxdHB6b8nlSWIFOLK7TKTV-Xxv7czzCZIVTAxg/edit#heading=h.f209dtpr7col).

If you want to control libraries per file, go to the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù tab on a file. This is
also where you can drag in components to your file. Click the book icon in the upper
corner. From the modal, you can turn libraries on and off.

![Buttons to click in Figma to open the library selector](../../../assets/images/design-guidelines/figma-open-library-modal.png)
![Modal in Figma where you can select the Paste components library to link to your project](../../../assets/images/design-guidelines/figma-link-paste-libraries.png)

The main libraries we recommend you have enabled for each file are:

- ‚ÄúConsole-navigation‚Äù for Teams with Console projects
- ‚ÄúPaste Components‚Äù
- ‚ÄúPaste Default Theme‚Äù includes tokens (color, text, and shadow styles), needed for the Paste components library.
- ‚ÄúPaste Patterns‚Äù
- ‚ÄúFile and Cover Sheet Template‚Äù includes a cover sheet template

Any time a library is updated, you‚Äôll get a notification in the file asking if you‚Äôd like to update.

##### Paste Components library

<Tooltip text="There is ongoing maintenance and net new work in this project. Libraries in this project are at parity with code.">
  <Box
    role="button"
    as="span"
    display="inline-block"
    width="auto"
    marginBottom="space50"
    paddingTop="space20"
    paddingBottom="space20"
    paddingLeft="space30"
    paddingRight="space30"
    borderColor="colorBorder"
    borderWidth="borderWidth10"
    borderStyle="solid"
    borderRadius="borderRadius20"
  >
    <Stack as="span" orientation="horizontal" spacing="space20">
      <SuccessIcon decorative={false} title="Success icon" color="colorTextSuccess" />
      <Text as="p">Actively maintained</Text>
    </Stack>
  </Box>
</Tooltip>

The `Paste Components` library contains components that are available in Paste. For example,
within the `Paste components` project, we have a `button`, which has all variants and states of
our button component as seen on this documentation website.

##### Paste Default Theme library

<Tooltip text="There is ongoing maintenance and net new work in this project. Libraries in this project are at parity with code.">
  <Box
    role="button"
    as="span"
    display="inline-block"
    width="auto"
    marginBottom="space50"
    paddingTop="space20"
    paddingBottom="space20"
    paddingLeft="space30"
    paddingRight="space30"
    borderColor="colorBorder"
    borderWidth="borderWidth10"
    borderStyle="solid"
    borderRadius="borderRadius20"
  >
    <Stack as="span" orientation="horizontal" spacing="space20">
      <SuccessIcon decorative={false} title="Success icon" color="colorTextSuccess" />
      <Text as="p">Actively maintained</Text>
    </Stack>
  </Box>
</Tooltip>

The design tokens are housed in the `Paste Default Theme` library. They contain
the [tokens](/tokens) available for use in the system.

##### Paste Patterns library

<Tooltip text="There is ongoing maintenance and net new work in this project. Libraries in this project are at parity with code.">
  <Box
    role="button"
    as="span"
    display="inline-block"
    width="auto"
    marginBottom="space50"
    paddingTop="space20"
    paddingBottom="space20"
    paddingLeft="space30"
    paddingRight="space30"
    borderColor="colorBorder"
    borderWidth="borderWidth10"
    borderStyle="solid"
    borderRadius="borderRadius20"
  >
    <Stack as="span" orientation="horizontal" spacing="space20">
      <SuccessIcon decorative={false} title="Success icon" color="colorTextSuccess" />
      <Text as="p">Actively maintained</Text>
    </Stack>
  </Box>
</Tooltip>

A Figma library housing [Paste patterns](/patterns)

#### Using the library

Once you have this library linked, you will see text styles (which include text colors, font families, and font sizes) and layer
styles (which include background colors, border widths and colors, shadows, etc.) for that theme.

![Menu in Figma when you can navigate through tokens for the Default theme](../../../assets/images/design-guidelines/token-styles.png)

You should be using components from Paste to compose your UIs whenever possible, but the text and layer styles will be helpful when you need to compose something more custom.
This can be anything from setting a piece of text next to an icon to creating a custom stepper component. Check out this [how-to](https://www.loom.com/share/7f3fe097ad9d4c5abf2a5cd0cdd0846a) for
using these text and layer styles to create custom compositions.

#### Library release roadmap and notices

The DSYS Design Team releases library updates on a 6-week cadence. [Take a look at our roadmap](/roadmap) to see release dates, as well as what will be included in each release (note that the
roadmap is approximate, so each release may look a little bit different than what‚Äôs on the roadmap due to shifting priorities).

With each release, we will make an announcement in the `#team-ux` channel, as well as send out an email to the UX team. This announcement will outline all changes included in that release, and there will be special
callouts for any [major changes](#types-of-library-changes) and how to safely accept those changes into your design files.

#### Types of library changes

##### Major

Breaking changes that require work to incorporate into designs. For example, symbols changed size, requiring designers to realign design elements; or symbol overrides reset, requiring designers to reapply them.

##### Minor

Non-breaking functionality was added that requires no work to incorporate. For example, a new button variant was added, or a token value was adjusted.

##### Patch

Non-breaking bug fixes that require no work to incorporate. For example, the alignment of text in an input was fixed, or an incorrect border radius on small buttons was updated.

### Additional questions or concerns

If you have any questions for us that weren‚Äôt covered by this guide, or you are running into problems using our design resources, please [reach out](/getting-started/working-guide)!

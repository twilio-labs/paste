| [Components](/components)       | Styled, accessible UI that looks and feels like Twilio (or the Theme that you're currently using)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Themes](/tokens/theme-package) | Globally scoped variations of the design language used by Tokens (and subsequently by Components and Compositions). We use Themes to provide a transitional tool for products to switch their UI from older languages to Paste. In the future, themes may also be used to provide light and dark modes for UIs, or for Twilio customers to match their brand personality while still retaining Paste interaction patterns. |
| [Layouts](/layouts)             | Ways to responsively space, align, and position your UI in a variety of ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Paste is...

- **Accessible by default.** As a principle, the design systems team does not ship a component, primitive, or composition if it does not meet or surpass our target of WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance. This means that as a consuming team, you can expect a lot of the heavy lifting required to build accessible products to be done by Paste. However, you must still think about, and regularly audit your product for accessibility. The Design Systems team can support you on this work.
- **Composable by design.** Paste tokens, primitives, components, and compositions themselves are inherently composable. This means, in the simplest of terms, that you can use small or large pieces interchangably to solve your product / UI problems.

## Paste is not...

- **Concerned with application logic.** All Paste components are presentational, and have no opinions on the way data is passed to them.
- **Stateful.** While components have encapsulated internal state when necessary (e.g.UI behavior or keyboard interaction), the components themselves are not concerned with application state.
- **Product or domain specific.** Paste components aim to serve all UI needs semantically, and Paste compositions aim to serve Twilio pattern needs at the most generic level. We believe that a good design system raises the floor of great customer experience, and are excited to see thoughtful, well-researched ejections from the system that raise the ceiling.

Illustration helps breathe life into our brand. It can take a complex idea and make it easier to understand. It is a tool that allows us to communicate our product in a way that feels human and fun.

Our illustration style is carefully curated by the Twilio Brand team. While adding these elements to your UI, ensure that you are reviewing your work with them. A good place to start is by posting in #mkg-brand.

### General guidelines for product UIs

- Only make necessary and thoughtful adjustments to the illustration colors. When doing so, ensure that youâ€™re using Paste's palette.
- Do not add extraneous elements to the illustrations. You may remove unnecessary elements, but do so while maintaining the thematic feel that the illustration is trying to convey.
- We recommend using SVGs over PNGs when possible, in order to improve performance and avoid blurring.

### Accessibility

- **Aim to pair your illustrations with text:** Remember that different cultures may interpret the same image in different ways so despite our best intentions it is helpful to provide adjoining text.
- **Illustrations shouldn't be interactive**: Illustrations should not have interactions such as click or hover behavior. Instead they should be wrapped with an (or, ideally, laid out with supporting) interactive element such as Anchor.
- **Give your illustrations a title:** A title is required so assistive technology can infer equal meaning as a sighted user would.

### Request new illustrations

<Paragraph>
  The best way to request new illustrations is to file a request with the Brand team. You can create a new{' '}

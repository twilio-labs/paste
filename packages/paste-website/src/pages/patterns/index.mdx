## What is a pattern?

A pattern outlines how to bring a collection of components together to create a reusable solution that solves customer problems and brings consistency to our platforms. They a set of guidelines around a particular user flow or interaction that designers and engineers should follow when creating customer experiences.

There are two primary goals of patterns:
- To drive efficiency across Twilio product teams by ensuring that no one needs to solve the same problem twice.
- To establish consistency across Twilio products so that users do not need to re-learn how to perform certain actions as they move from product to product.

## Our approach to patterns

We rely on contributions to build out and refine our pattern library. Please give feedback on existing patterns (you can find links to provide feedback on individual pattern pages), and learn more about [how to contribute a new pattern](/patterns/contribute).

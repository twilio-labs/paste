## Upcoming Release

Paste's upcoming release will be on **May 19, 2020**. This is what we've planned:

- Many more Form components in this release! We’ll ship **Select**, **Checkbox**, **Checkbox Group**, **Radio**, and **Radio Group** for Sketch and React. 📝

- We’ve heard that many of your are baking bread whilst we are cloistered at home. We see you, and will ship a **Toast Component** as tribute. 🍞

- We’ll ship a **Stack** layout component to allow for more flexible layouts of your UIs. 📐

- But wait, there’s more: the hotly anticipated **Divider Component** will be shipped in this release. 📏

## Future Releases

Future releases of Paste are scheduled for every six weeks, with the next release on **June 20, 2020**. This release is still TBD, and our guidance on what’s planned will update as we get closer to the date. For now, here's what we're hoping to do:

- Add an icon list to the [icon system guidelines](/icon-system) with more design guidelines. 👩🏽‍🎤

- Ship an update to the Paste homepage and navigation.

- Ship a Combobox component 🔽

## Motivation

Paste is built by just a few people, but the reach of our libraries are great.  One of the team's 
charters is creating a culture of prototypical design and development. While we work on building 
out the design system, certain challenges we face are best solved by standalone tooling, 
complimentary to and re-useable outside the framework of a design system.

All of the libraries here are first-party; we actively support them and hope they provide you with as much
value as they provide us.  


## Libraries


### [SVG-to-React](https://github.com/twilio-labs/svg-to-react)

SVG-to-React allows users to generate fully-formed and accessible React components from an SVG input.
The ouput will work similarly to the icons provided in Paste.  This library was created to allow for 
self-service when suggesting new Paste icons or when individual product needs differ from Paste.
You can rest easy knowing you're building out icons or larger SVG illustrations the right way when
using this library.  It is powered by the superb [SVGR](https://github.com/gregberge/svgr) library.


### [Sketch Twilio Ipsum](https://github.com/twilio-labs/sketch-twilio-ipsum/releases)

A [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) plugin to help populate mockups with "real" data. 
We believe there’s power in working with realistic and meaningful data as early as possible 
in the design process because:
- Content can inform design decisions and help you convey your purpose
- Real data can reveal edge cases in your work that would otherwise be caught during development
- It’s fun!

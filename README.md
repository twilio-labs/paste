## Hosting Storybook

We use GitHub pages to host the Storybook instance. We use the `gh-pages` branch and the ![`gh-pages` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to manage this.

### `gh-pages` branch

The `gh-pages` branch ignores _everything_ other than the built storybook instance in the root of the directory. The package handles everything.

### https://twilio-labs.github.io/paste

#### Updating

To update this we simply run the `gh-pages` package from yarn by using the `release:storybook` task.

```bash
yarn release:storybook
```

This task will build the storybook, switch to the `gh-pages` branch, commit the changes from the storybook build and push to GitHub.

## Guidelines

### About the Combobox Primitive

This package provides a foundation upon which developers can implement a [WAI-Aria compliant Combobox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/combobox/aria1.1pattern/listbox-combo.html).
It can be used to build functional and accessible Comboboxes with or without autocomplete/typeahead features.
Our Combobox is built on top of this primitive.

The purpose of providing these unstyled primitives is to cater for instances when the styled Combobox provided
by Paste, doesn't meet the requirements needed to solve a unique or individual customer problem. At that point
you are welcome to fallback to this functional primitive to roll your own styled Combobox whilst still providing
a functional and accessible experience to your customers.

This primitive should be used to compose all custom Comboboxes to ensure accessibility and upgrade paths.

<Callout variant="warning">
  <CalloutTitle>Warning</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    We strongly suggest that all components built on top of this primitive get reviewed by the Design Systems team and
    goes through the UX Review process to ensure an excellent experience for our customers.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

## Usage Guide

This package is a wrapper around the [`Downshift` package](https://downshift.netlify.com).
Our wrapper currently only exposes the useCombobox hook, but renamed for Paste. The reason we chose
to just expose the hook is that we feel it is the most flexible way of consuming downshift and better
fit our chosen styling model.

If you’re wondering why we wrapped that package into our own, we reasoned that it would be
best for our consumers' developer experience. For example:

- If we want to migrate the underlying nuts and bolts in the future, Twilio products
  that depend on this primitive would need to replace all occurrences of `import … from ‘x-package’`
  to `import … from ‘@some-new/package’`. By wrapping it in `@twilio-paste/x-primitive`, this
  refactor can be avoided. The only change would be a version bump in the package.json file for the primitive.
- We can more strictly enforce semver and backwards compatibility than some of our dependencies.
- We can control when to provide an update and which versions we allow, to help reduce potential
  bugs our consumers may face.
- We can control which APIs we expose. For example, we may chose to enable or disable usage of
  certain undocumented APIs.

### Installation

This package is available individually or as part of `@twilio-paste/core`.

```
yarn add @twilio-paste/combobox-primitive - or - yarn add @twilio-paste/core
```

### Examples

#### Basic Combobox

A basic Combobox is a direct replacement for the native HTML select element. It should function in roughly
the same way, the difference being in the ability to style everything about it; the input trigger, option list
and option content.

Contrary to the Downshift documentation and example, the basic Combobox should have an HTML input element as
the trigger, and not an HTML button. Use an input element and set the role of Combobox in the `getToggleButtonProps`
getter or directly on the element itself. You can see this demonstrated below:

<Callout>
  <CalloutText>
    Using an input element prevents screen readers like JAWS switching out of focus or forms mode when navigating
    through a form. This provides a really frustrating experience to users of JAWS. It is also a direct replacement for
    a form element, so the value should be accessible via the form submit event, which a button element will not
    provide.

#### Autcomplete Combobox Example

This hook can be used to create custom autocomplete Combobox controls. These controls are useful when the
customer needs to filter a list of available options, or provide a custom free form value to the input.

### useComboboxPrimitive Arguments

#### Basic Props

This is the list of props that you should probably know about. There are some
[advanced props](#advanced-props) below as well.

##### items `any[]` | _required_

The main difference from vanilla `Downshift` is that we pass the items we want
to render to the hook as well. Opening the menu with an item already selected
means the hook has to know in advance what items you plan to render and what is
the position of that item in the list. Consequently, there won't be any need for
two state changes: one for opening the menu and one for setting the highlighted
index, like in `Downshift`.

##### itemToString `function(item: any)` | defaults to: `item => (item ? String(item) : '')`

If your items are stored as, say, objects instead of strings, downshift still
needs a string representation for each one. This is required for accessibility
messages (e.g., after making a selection).

**Note:** This callback _must_ include a null check: it is invoked with `null`
whenever the user abandons input via `<Esc>`.

##### onSelectedItemChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the selected item was changed. Selection can be performed by
item click, Enter Key while item is highlighted or by blurring the menu while an
item is highlighted (Tab, Shift-Tab or clicking away).

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `selectedItem` property
  with the newly selected value. This also has a `type` property which you can
  learn more about in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#statechangetypes) section. This
  property will be part of the actions that can trigger a `selectedItem` change,
  for example `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.ItemClick`.

##### stateReducer `function(state: object, actionAndChanges: object)` | optional

**🚨 This is a really handy power feature 🚨**

This function will be called each time `useCombobox` sets its internal state (or
calls your `onStateChange` handler for control props). It allows you to modify
the state change that will take place which can give you fine grain control over
how the component interacts with user updates. It gives you the current state
and the state that will be set, and you return the state that you want to set.

- `state`: The full current state of downshift.
- `actionAndChanges`: Object that contains the action `type`, props needed to
  return a new state based on that type and the changes suggested by the
  Downshift default reducer. About the `type` property you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#statechangetypes) section.

#### Advanced Props

##### initialSelectedItem `any` | defaults to `null`

Pass an item that should be selected when downshift is initialized.

##### initialIsOpen `boolean` | defaults to `false`

Pass a boolean that sets the open state of the menu when downshift is
initialized.

##### initialHighlightedIndex `number` | defaults to `-1`

Pass a number that sets the index of the highlighted item when downshift is
initialized.

##### initialInputValue `string` | defaults to `''`

Pass a string that sets the content of the input when downshift is initialized.

##### defaultSelectedItem `any` | defaults to `null`

Pass an item that should be selected when downshift is reset.

##### defaultIsOpen `boolean` | defaults to `false`

Pass a boolean that sets the open state of the menu when downshift is reset or
when an item is selected.

##### defaultHighlightedIndex `number` | defaults to `-1`

Pass a number that sets the index of the highlighted item when downshift is
reset or when an item is selected.

##### defaultInputValue `string` | defaults to `''`

Pass a string that sets the content of the input when downshift is reset or when
an item is selected.

##### getA11yStatusMessage `function({/* see below */})` | default messages provided in English

This function is passed as props to a status updating function nested within
that allows you to create your own ARIA statuses. It is called when one of the
following props change: `items`, `highlightedIndex`, `inputValue` or `isOpen`.

A default `getA11yStatusMessage` function is provided that will check
`resultCount` and return "No results are available." or if there are results ,
"`resultCount` results are available, use up and down arrow keys to navigate.
Press Enter key to select."

##### getA11ySelectionMessage `function({/* see below */})` | default messages provided in English

This function is similar to the `getA11yStatusMessage` but it is generating a
message when an item is selected. It is passed as props to a status updating
function nested within that allows you to create your own ARIA statuses. It is
called when `selectedItem` changes.

A default `getA11ySelectionMessage` function is provided. When an item is
selected, the message is a selection related one, narrating
"`itemToString(selectedItem)` has been selected".

The object you are passed to generate your status message, for both
`getA11yStatusMessage` and `getA11ySelectionMessage`, has the following
properties:

| property              | type            | description                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `highlightedIndex`    | `number`        | The currently highlighted index                                                              |
| `highlightedItem`     | `any`           | The value of the highlighted item                                                            |
| `isOpen`              | `boolean`       | The `isOpen` state                                                                           |
| `inputValue`          | `string`        | The value in the text input.                                                                 |
| `itemToString`        | `function(any)` | The `itemToString` function (see props) for getting the string value from one of the options |
| `previousResultCount` | `number`        | The total items showing in the dropdown the last time the status was updated                 |
| `resultCount`         | `number`        | The total items showing in the dropdown                                                      |
| `selectedItem`        | `any`           | The value of the currently selected item                                                     |

##### onHighlightedIndexChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the highlighted item was changed. Items can be highlighted
while hovering the mouse over them or by keyboard keys such as Up Arrow, Down
Arrow, Home and End. Arrow keys can be combined with Shift to move by a step of
5 positions instead of 1. Items can also be highlighted by hitting character
keys that are part of their starting string equivalent.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `highlightedIndex`
  property with the new value. This also has a `type` property which you can
  learn more about in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#statechangetypes) section. This
  property will be part of the actions that can trigger a `highlightedIndex`
  change, for example `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.MenuKeyDownArrowUp`.

##### onIsOpenChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the menu is open or closed. Menu can be open by toggle button
click, Enter, Space, Up Arrow or Down Arrow keys. Can be closed by selecting an
item, blur (Tab, Shift-Tab or clicking outside), clicking the toggle button
again or hitting Escape key.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `isOpen` property with
  the new value. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#statechangetypes) section. This property will be
  part of the actions that can trigger a `isOpen` change, for example
  `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.ToggleButtonClick`.

##### onInputValueChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the value in the input text changes. The input value should
change like any input of type text, at any character key press, `Space`,
`Backspace`, `Escape` etc.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `inputValue` property
  with the new value. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more
  about in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#statechangetypes) section. This property
  will be part of the actions that can trigger a `inputValue` change, for
  example `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputChange`.

##### onStateChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

This function is called anytime the internal state changes. This can be useful
if you're using downshift as a "controlled" component, where you manage some or
all of the state (e.g., isOpen, selectedItem, highlightedIndex, etc) and then
pass it as props, rather than letting downshift control all its state itself.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#statechangetypes) section.

##### highlightedIndex

> `number`

The index of the item that should be highlighted when menu is open.

##### isOpen `boolean`

The open state of the menu.

##### selectedItem `any`

The item that should be selected.

##### inputValue `string`

The value to be displayed in the text input.

##### id `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used to generate the first part of the `Downshift` id on the elements. You can
override this `id` with one of your own, provided as a prop, or you can override
the `id` for each element altogether using the props below.

##### labelId `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`label`) you use
[`getLabelProps`](#getlabelprops) with.

##### menuId `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`ul`) you use
[`getMenuProps`](#getmenuprops) with.

##### toggleButtonId `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`button`) you use
[`getToggleButtonProps`](#gettogglebuttonprops) with.

##### inputId `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`input`) you use
[`getInputProps`](#getmenuprops) with.

##### getItemId `function(index)` | defaults to a function that generates an ID based on the

> index

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`li`) you use
[`getItemProps`](#getitemprops) with.

##### environment `window` | defaults to `window`

This prop is only useful if you're rendering downshift within a different
`window` context from where your JavaScript is running; for example, an iframe
or a shadow-root. If the given context is lacking `document` and/or
`add|removeEventListener` on its prototype (as is the case for a shadow-root)
then you will need to pass in a custom object that is able to provide
[access to these properties](https://gist.github.com/Rendez/1dd55882e9b850dd3990feefc9d6e177)
for downshift.

##### circularNavigation `boolean` | defaults to `true`

Controls the circular keyboard navigation between items. If set to `true`, when
first item is highlighted, the Arrow Up will move highlight to the last item,
and viceversa using Arrow Down.

### useComboboxPrimitive Returned

##### getLabelProps

This method should be applied to the `label` you render. It will generate an
`id` that will be used to label the toggle button and the menu.

There are no required properties for this method.

> Note: For accessibility purposes, calling this method is highly recommended.

##### getMenuProps

This method should be applied to the element which contains your list of items.
Typically, this will be a `<div>` or a `<ul>` that surrounds a `map` expression.
This handles the proper ARIA roles and attributes.

Optional properties:

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getMenuProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})` and
  your composite component would forward like: `<ul ref={props.innerRef} />`.
  However, if you are just rendering a primitive component like `<div>`, there
  is no need to specify this property. It defaults to `ref`.

  Please keep in mind that menus, for accessiblity purposes, should always be
  rendered, regardless of whether you hide it or not. Otherwise, `getMenuProps`
  may throw error if you unmount and remount the menu.

- `aria-label`: By default the menu will add an `aria-labelledby` that refers to
  the `<label>` rendered with `getLabelProps`. However, if you provide
  `aria-label` to give a more specific label that describes the options
  available, then `aria-labelledby` will not be provided and screen readers can
  use your `aria-label` instead.

In some cases, you might want to completely bypass the `refKey` check. Then you
can provide the object `{suppressRefError : true}` as the second argument to
`getMenuProps`. **Please use it with extreme care and only if you are absolutely
sure that the ref is correctly forwarded otherwise `useCombobox` will
unexpectedly fail.**

> Note that for accessibility reasons it's best if you always render this
> element whether or not downshift is in an `isOpen` state.

##### getItemProps

The props returned from calling this function should be applied to any menu
items you render.

**This is an impure function**, so it should only be called when you will
actually be applying the props to an item.

Required properties:

The main difference from vanilla `Downshift` is that we require the items as
props before rendering. The reason is to open the menu with items already
highlighted, and we need to know the items before the actual render. It is still
required to pass either `item` or `index` to `getItemProps`.

- `item`: this is the item data that will be selected when the user selects a
  particular item.
- `index`: This is how `downshift` keeps track of your item when updating the
  `highlightedIndex` as the user keys around. By default, `downshift` will
  assume the `index` is the order in which you're calling `getItemProps`. This
  is often good enough, but if you find odd behavior, try setting this
  explicitly. It's probably best to be explicit about `index` when using a
  windowing library like `react-virtualized`.

Optional properties:

- `ref`: if you need to access the item element via a ref object, you'd call the
  function like this: `getItemProps({ref: yourItemRef})`. As a result, the item
  element will receive a composed `ref` property, which guarantees that both
  your code and `useCombobox` use the same correct reference to the element.

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getItemProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})` and
  your composite component would forward like: `<li ref={props.innerRef} />`.
  However, if you are just rendering a primitive component like `<div>`, there
  is no need to specify this property. It defaults to `ref`.

- `disabled`: If this is set to `true`, then all of the downshift item event
  handlers will be omitted. Items will not be highlighted when hovered, and
  items will not be selected when clicked.

##### getToggleButtonProps

Call this and apply the returned props to a `button`. It allows you to toggle
the `Menu` component.

Optional properties:

- `ref`: if you need to access the button element via a ref object, you'd call
  the function like this: `getToggleButton({ref: yourButtonRef})`. As a result,
  the button element will receive a composed `ref` property, which guarantees
  that both your code and `useCombobox` use the same correct reference to the
  element.

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getToggleButton({refKey: 'innerRef'})`
  and your composite component would forward like:
  `<button ref={props.innerRef} />`. However, if you are just rendering a
  primitive component like `<div>`, there is no need to specify this property.
  It defaults to `ref`.

- `disabled`: If this is set to `true`, then all of the downshift button event
  handlers will be omitted (it won't toggle the menu when clicked).

##### getInputProps

This method should be applied to the `input` you render. It is recommended that
you pass all props as an object to this method which will compose together any
of the event handlers you need to apply to the `input` while preserving the ones
that `downshift` needs to apply to make the `input` behave.

There are no required properties for this method.

Optional properties:

- `disabled`: If this is set to true, then no event handlers will be returned
  from `getInputProps` and a `disabled` prop will be returned (effectively
  disabling the input).

- `ref`: if you need to access the input element via a ref object, you'd call
  the function like this: `getInputProps({ref: yourInputRef})`. As a result, the
  input element will receive a composed `ref` property, which guarantees that
  both your code and `useCombobox` use the same correct reference to the
  element.

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getInputProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})` and
  your composite component would forward like: `<input ref={props.innerRef} />`.
  However, if you are just rendering a primitive component like `<div>`, there
  is no need to specify this property. It defaults to `ref`.

In some cases, you might want to completely bypass the `refKey` check. Then you
can provide the object `{suppressRefError : true}` as the second argument to
`getInput`. **Please use it with extreme care and only if you are absolutely
sure that the ref is correctly forwarded otherwise `useCombobox` will
unexpectedly fail.**

##### getComboboxProps

This method should be applied to the `input` wrapper element. It has similar
return values to the `getRootProps` from vanilla `Downshift`, but renaming it as
it's not a root element anymore. We are encouraging the correct `combobox` HTML
structure as having the combobox wrapper as a root for the rest of the elements
broke navigation and readings with assistive technologies. The wrapper should
contain the `input` and the `toggleButton` and it should be on the same level
with the `menu`.

There are no required properties for this method.

In some cases, you might want to completely bypass the `refKey` check. Then you
can provide the object `{suppressRefError : true}` as the second argument to
`getComboboxProps`. **Please use it with extreme care and only if you are
absolutely sure that the ref is correctly forwarded otherwise `useCombobox` will
unexpectedly fail.**

#### Actions

These are functions you can call to change the state of the downshift
`useCombobox` hook.

| property              | type                      | description                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `closeMenu`           | `function()`              | closes the menu                                       |
| `openMenu`            | `function()`              | opens the menu                                        |
| `selectItem`          | `function(item: any)`     | selects the given item                                |
| `setHighlightedIndex` | `function(index: number)` | call to set a new highlighted index                   |
| `setInputValue`       | `function(value: string)` | call to set a new value in the input                  |
| `toggleMenu`          | `function()`              | toggle the menu open state                            |
| `reset`               | `function()`              | this resets downshift's state to a reasonable default |

#### State

These are values that represent the current state of the downshift component.

| property           | type      | description                       |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `highlightedIndex` | `number`  | the currently highlighted item    |
| `isOpen`           | `boolean` | the menu open state               |

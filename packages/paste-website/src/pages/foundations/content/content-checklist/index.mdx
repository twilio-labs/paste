How do you know if your content is "done" or "good"?

**The content meets the user's immediate needs.**
- The user can understand the context, the goal, the impact of any actions or decisions they’ll make, and knows what happens next.

**The words and structure are as simple as they can be.**
- Sentences are short.
- You've eliminated jargon where possible, and explained technical language if it’s required.

**The message is clear and unambiguous.**
- Your content can only be interpreted one way.
- You've replaced any vague or imprecise language with precise, clear terms.

**The tone is appropriate to the scenario.**
- Content generally sounds like a friendly specialist.

| Scenario  | Tone |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Stressful situation  | Content provides factual information and informs the user about what they can do next. Content tone is empathetic and reassuring. |
| Successful situation  | Content celebrates the user. Content tone is positive and encouraging. |
| Repeated interaction | Content reduces friction and anticipates user needs. Content tone is positive and conversational. |

**The content aligns with our [style guide](/foundations/content/product-style-guide) and [word list](/foundations/content/word-list).**
- Capitalization, punctuation, and terms all align with current guidance.

**Bonus: Someone unfamiliar with the project has read and understood it.**
- Ask them to read it out loud, then tell you what it means.
- If their understanding matches your intent, your content is clear.
- If they stumble on words or don't understand, ask why. Use their feedback to iterate, then try again.

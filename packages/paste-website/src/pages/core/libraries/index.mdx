All of these libraries are first-party; we actively support them and hope they provide you with as much value as they provide us.

## Libraries

### [uid-library](/core/libraries/uid-library)

This is used to generate unique `id` values throughout React applications. This is most commonly used for
mapping form labels to form inputs, or mapping titles for accessibility. This library works when SSR and dynamically importing
application code.

### [SVG-to-React](https://github.com/twilio-labs/svg-to-react)

SVG-to-React allows users to generate fully-formed and accessible React components from an SVG input.
The output will work similarly to the icons provided in Paste. This library was created to allow for
self-service when suggesting new Paste icons or when individual product needs differ from Paste. For more
information, see our [icon guidelines](/components/icons/usage-guidelines) and our [how-to docs](/introduction/contributing/icons).

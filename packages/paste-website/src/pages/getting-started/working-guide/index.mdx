## Getting help from the DSYS Team

### When should you talk to the Design Systems team?

Product Designers at Twilio are expected to partner with the Design Systems team for their work. We recommend reaching out early, and often! The DSYS team provides [many ways to connect with the team that are timezone friendly](/getting-started/working-guide#design-systems-meetings), and offer a safe, inclusive space to incubate your ideas as they becomes great Twilio experiences. Here are some _checkpoints_ that are great times to reach out to our team.

- **After your first week at Twilio!** Come say hi at #help-design-system on Slack and introduce yourselves! We'd love to hear your journey, and share how our team works.
- You'll be invited every **Quarter** to our roadmap planning sessions: share what's coming up from a UI perspective, and any components or compositions that you believe will be essential to build a great customer experience. Post in #help-design-system if you have questions.
- **At the start of a project** - reach out to us at our weekly office hours with a heads up on the project, any deadlines for delivery, and any components or compositions that you're confident will be necessary.
- **At the start of medium or high fidelity design.** This is a great time to share your specific needs with the DSYS team. You may also begin to receive feedback on accessibility or pattern usage at this stage.
- **Before user testing or UX reviews.** Before you share your ideas with customers or get a sign off on the final design, drop by for a deep dive on copy, component and composition usage, accessibility, and other design considerations.
- **Before launch.** We'll use this time to do a final polish on the work, and discuss what changes we may need to make after your product's released.

### What kind of support can you expect from the Design Systems team?

We're excited to partner with you on building better products. Towards this, you can expect the following levels of support from the team:

- Get feedback on usage of Paste components and compositions in your mocks and/or UIs.
- Get information about building more accessible UIs, and any common pitfalls that designers typically encounter.
- Get support on hierarchy, weight, and spacing in your UIs.
- Get answers to clarifying questions about Design Systems concepts.
- Verify if your designs are aligned with the [Paste content guidelines](https://paste.twilio.design/content)
- Get constructive feedback that helps your design follow design system and accessibility conventions that are expected for Twilio UX reviews.

It's important to note that the Design Systems team does not directly talk to customers, and is not a replacement for research and customer understanding. While we're happy to provide feedback on the product decisions made, we recommend testing with customers or customer proxies to better understand if we're solving for their needs.

### Support questions, feature requests, and bug reports

- We recommend searching this doc site before reaching out to the team for help. It may be the quickest way to get you going.
- Still need help? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/discussions/new) on GitHub. Paste is free and open-source, so all you need is a free GitHub account to post questions.
- Spotted a bug or error? [File an issue](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)

### Design Systems Meetings

These meetings should be visible on the UX Calendar. If you have trouble finding them, reach out at #help-design-system on Slack.

- We host **weekly office hours** on Thursdays alternating North America and Europe friendly time zones.
- We also host a **weekly design critique**, that's specifically a space for product designers to get feedback on their work.
- We also host a **monthly design system guild meeting**, a monthly meetup for developers, designers, and product managers interested in building better experiences for customers.

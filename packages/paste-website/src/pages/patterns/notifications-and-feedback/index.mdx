## Ingredients

Each notification or feedback pattern uses one or more of these components.

## Usage

### General usage

Pairing thoughtful content writing with the appropriate UI elements can help you establish trust with customers by notifying them of relevant information at just the right time. Use these patterns only when the user **needs** to be notified.

In general, notifications should close when a user leaves the page. A notification should follow a user through the product only in the most critical cases, like an Alert informing a customer that their paid account won’t renew soon because of expired billing information.

Too many notifications that appear for too long may lead to alert fatigue, causing users to ignore important information.

There are 3 levels of notifications and feedback:

- **System-initiated notifications:** Information that’s not triggered by a user action and is related to system issues.
- **Feedback indicators:** Acknowledgment of a user action, like submitting a form or pressing a “Copy code” button.
- **Notification centers and reminders:** Currently, these are highly specific to products’ business needs and should be treated as a product feature, rather than a pattern. While the implementation of a notification center might use Paste components, guidelines specific to a notification center won’t be covered in this page.

<Callout variant="neutral" marginY="space70">
  <CalloutHeading as="h4">Notifications in high-emotion or high-stress situations</CalloutHeading>
  <CalloutText>
    For high-emotion or high-stress parts of the customer journey, use a component that appropriately matches the
    customer's level of emotion. For example, to confirm that a customer has successfully upgraded their account, you
    may want to use a full-page confirmation that celebrates the moment, instead of a simple toast.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

Notifications and feedback can come in 4 variants:

- **Success:** Confirms a successful or completed action.
- **Error:** Communicates critical information that's actively preventing a user from continuing a flow.
- **Warning:** Communicates critical information that will help a user avoid a potential issue, but won’t prevent them from continuing their immediate goal.
- **Neutral:** Informs a user of general changes, or processes that have been triggered by a user action but will take time to finish.

### Accessibility

Give users enough time to read a notification message, make a decision, and act on their decision. Users’ reading speeds, vision levels, literacy levels, dexterity, and familiarity with Twilio products can all affect how much time they’ll need to interact with a notification.

Visit the [Alert](/components/alert), [Modal](/components/modal), [Form](/components/form), and [Toast](/components/toast) pages for more specific guidelines on how to implement each component accessibly.

## Notification and feedback levels

### System-initiated notifications

To communicate information from the system that isn't triggered by a user action, use an **[Alert](/components/alert)**, especially for high-priority or time-sensitive changes to the system.

<ResponsiveImage src={NotificationsAlertImage} alt="Screen with alert informing users of a server error" />

### Feedback indicators

To communicate feedback on a user action, use a **[Toast](/components/toast)**, **[Callout](/components/callout)**, **[Modal](/components/modal)**, **[Help Text](/components/help-text)**, and/or **in-page messaging** (e.g., full-page confirmation).

While you’ll only need one type of feedback indicator in most cases, pairing 2 feedback indicators can help give users more clarity in completing a complex flow. For example, when a user submits a long form with an error, you can show an error Toast that lets users know they need to fix a form, while also showing error Help Text on the incorrect field.

#### Standard feedback indicator (Toast)

Use a Toast when

- You’re communicating a direct response to a user action. Example: "asset.jpg" successfully added.
- You're providing only one link or button to help a user continue a flow.
- There’s no other way for a user to immediately know that their action was acknowledged. For example, a Toast isn't needed when a Modal closes after a user presses “Save” in it. The dismissal of the Modal can communicate that the information was saved, without needing further messaging.

<ResponsiveImage
  src={NotificationsToastImage}
  alt="Screen with Toast confirming a password reset email has been sent"
/>

#### Interruptive feedback indicator (Modal)

Use a Modal when

- You’re interrupting a user flow.
- You’re focusing a user’s attention and confirming a definitive action at the end of a Modal flow.
- You’re providing lengthy text, multiple links, or multiple buttons to help a user continue a flow.

<ResponsiveImage src={NotificationsModalImage} alt="Modal congratulating a user at the end of a Modal flow" />

#### Contextual feedback indicator (Help Text)

Use Help Text when

- You’re communicating a direct response to a user action.
- You’re providing links or buttons that are contextual to a UI element and help a user continue a flow.

<ResponsiveImage src={NotificationsInlineMessagingImage} alt="Screen with inline error with anchor on a form field" />

#### High-emotion feedback indicator (In-page messaging)

Use in-page messaging (e.g., full-page confirmation) when

- You’re communicating a direct response to a _high-emotion_ user action or flow.
- You’re providing information that a user might want to copy, screenshot, or save, like a confirmation number or invoice details.

  src={NotificationsInpageMessagingImage}
  alt="Full-page congratulations message on setting up a Twilio Messaging Service with SIDs to copy"
/>

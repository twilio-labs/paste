## Introduction

Welcome! Paste is currently in early access. The intention of this release is to:

- Give clarity to the UX Org for what our vision for a Unified Design System is, through a working example. 
- Validate our ability to execute together as a larger systems team. 
- Get folks excited!

However, this release is not:

- Complete. This is a steel thread that requires active participation from the Systems team to make things work.
- Fully documented. Expect to see pages or sections that just say “Coming Soon” or “TBD”.
- Locked in on opinions. We always reserve the right to wake up smarter and rely on your feedback to do so.

## Getting Started with Paste

### Access for Font Files, Sketch Licenses, Abstract

<a href="https://wiki.hq.twilio.com/x/sTQdCw">Instructions for Download</a> (Confluence)

### Basic Terminology

If you’re unfamiliar with Abstract, version control, or git workflows, read through <a href="https://www.goabstract.com/how-it-works/">how it works</a>.

*Some terms you'll encounter:*

- *Abstract*: A version control app for Sketch, which means we can share a single source of truth for our Sketch files and not run into unmanageable edit conflicts.

- *Master*: The single source of truth of files in a project

- *Branch*: A copy of the Master files that lets you make any changes without affecting the rest of the team’s work. Only the creator of the branch can make changes in it. If you want to work off someone's branch, you can create a child branch off their branch.

- *Commit*: The way you save your work so it’s publicly viewable to the rest of the team. Committing is like saving a snapshot of your work, so you can revert your work back to previous commits when you need to. It does not affect the Master. Always Be Committing!

- *Merge*: The way you combine your branch with the Master files

- *Merge conflict*: This happens when there’s a conflicting version of an artboard with the Master and a branch. Abstract will walk you through which artboards are conflicting so you can choose what want to appear in Master.

- *Paste: _This_ design system

- *Console / Flex / SendGrid Components*: The Sketch library for the Twilio Console / Flex / SendGrid (some of this may not be available yet).

### Joining or Creating a New Project in Abstract

  <CalloutTitle as="h4">Early Access! Early Access! Early Access!</CalloutTitle>  
  <CalloutText>This section will be updated in the future for specific guidance for SendGrid and Flex Product Designers.</CalloutText>
</Callout>

1. After installing Abstract, sync the Console Components project. You may also want to sync all the other projects to be able to easily review and study your peer designer' work. Once they are synced, they should appear with their icons colored in. **You can star projects to pin them to the top of your projects list**

2. To find the right project for the product you’ll be working on, search through existing ones. To create a project, click New Project in Abstract and give your project a name. If it already exists, feel free to skip to Test Your Fonts.

<Callout>
  <CalloutText>Guidance on how to name your projects will be provided in a future release.</CalloutText>
</Callout>

3. After creating your project, click into it and create a Sketch file.

4. **Now it's time to import a Sketch Library!** Console components is the Sketch library for Paste, the Twilio design system. To use console symbols in your project, you’ll have to link the Console component Sketch libraries. To do that in your project, click on Add File, then Link Library...

5. Select *all the* Console component files, then click Link Libraries...

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle as="h4">Do a quick font check!</CalloutTitle>    
  <CalloutText>Now is a good time to test your fonts to ensure that the components look right! In Abstract, go to the DesignOps project and open *Font tester.sketch* in untracked mode. Use the Font Tester artboard to make sure your font files have been installed correctly. </CalloutText>
</Callout>

You're all set to work with Abstract and Paste Sketch Libraries!

### Your First Commit in Abstract

1. To start work in any project, you’ll create a branch. A branch is a copy of the Master file that lets you make any changes without affecting the rest of the team’s work.

To create a branch, click Master in the left sidebar and then click New Branch… in the upper right.

<Callout variant="warning">
  <CalloutTitle as="h4">Early Access! Early Access! Early Access!</CalloutTitle>  
  <CalloutText>This section will be updated in the future with specific guidance for Flex &amp; SendGrid.</CalloutText>
</Callout>

When you’re working in the Console component library, the branch naming convention is:

```
Product Designer Initials - [JIRA ticket] [description]

For example:

AI - [PROJ-1234] Added a new button
```

2. Once you’ve created your branch, go to the Overview tab and add a link to your documentation in the Summary section and a description for context.

3. To start working in Sketch, return to Files and double-click on a Sketch file.

4. Once you’ve made changes, you’ll commit your work. It does not affect the Master branch. Always Be Committing!


Any changes you make before you commit are saved locally to your computer and only viewable by you.

To commit, click Commit Changes on the Abstract plugin in Sketch.

When working on design system projects, please follow our commit message conventions below.


<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle as="h4">What's a Commit?</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>A commit is the way you save your work so it’s publicly viewable to the rest of the team. Committing is like saving a snapshot of your work, so you can revert your work back to previous commits when you need to.</CalloutText> 
  <CalloutText marginTop="space40">Any changes you make before you commit are saved locally to your computer and only viewable by you. To commit, click Commit Changes on the Abstract plugin in Sketch.</CalloutText>
</Callout>

5. **Changes in Abstract are tracked per artboard.** If you don't want to lose track of an Abstract comment thread on an artboard, make sure you don't delete it (even if you rename another artboard with the same name).


### Commit Message Conventions

Commit messages are important. You may be tempted to write "updates" as your commit's description while you're working hard, but will that be useful in six months when you're trying to find a specific exploration? We recommend using the `conventional commit` format for messages, which attaches a strict style to commits, and makes them readable: not just for you, but also for your peers!

<Callout variant="warning">
  <CalloutTitle as="h4">Commit Message Conventions are Mandatory for Design System Contributions</CalloutTitle>  
  <CalloutText>While we can only **strongly recommend** what you do in your own Abstract projects, following this convention is mandatory for Design System projects. We'll have to ask you to redo your branch, so please follow this format! </CalloutText>
</Callout>

| Commit type | Commit message syntax | Example |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Add / Edit / Delete Feature | feat: [description] | feat: Added a new button |
| Minor change / typo fix, library cleanup | chore: [description] | chore: wierd was spelled weirdly |
| Fixed a broken style or buggy component (no customer change) | fix: [description] | fix: Applied correct layer style for grey |

### Creating your own libraries

<Callout variant="warning">
  <CalloutTitle as="h4">Early Access! Early Access! Early Access!</CalloutTitle>  
  <CalloutText>This section will be updated in a future release.</CalloutText>
</Callout>

As your projects become more and more complex (or you start working on multiple projects), it may be useful for you to create your own local symbol library. Before you do this, we recommend reaching out to the Design System team for guidance.

## Give us Feedback on this Page

As you use Paste, you'll likely encounter things that _don't seem right_. Please reach out with your feedback! Here's some prompts to consider: 

- Is this page easy for me to consume?
- Is the information supporting it sufficient / well-described?
- What information is missing?
- How approachable is the documentation? Can a new engineer / PM / designer at Twilio get started with it easily?

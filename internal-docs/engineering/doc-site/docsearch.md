# Docsearch

The search is provided by [Algolia Docsearch v3](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/DocSearch-v3/).

The docsearch app login is stored in OnePassword, where you can [login here](https://www.algolia.com/).

The dashboard will give you analytics and some configurations and insights into the index that is created.

## Crawler

Docsearch crawls the website automatically via the crawler. It is recrawled every day. To configure the website crawler you must log into the [crawler application](https://crawler.algolia.com/).

The crawler is configured via the editor, and a configuration object. It controls where the sitemap live, how often to crawl, and how to extract data from the website pages into the search index.

Use the Crawler app to visualize what Algolia can extract from our web pages as it crawls, and test any configuration changes you make.

Crawler documentation can be found [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/apis/configuration/).

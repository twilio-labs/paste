 *  By setting the stroke dash array to be the circle circumference, we are drawing a stroke that looks continuous but is actually discrete (e.g. countable).
 *  We can then use the offset to "hide" parts of the total stroke, calculated as a percentage of the circle circumference.
 *  We can think of the stroke then as being measured in the same "units" that describe the circle's geometry, which makes styling the SVG simpler.

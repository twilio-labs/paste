### One Twilio: Design language update in Figma

<ResponsiveImage src={OneTwilio} />

We are excited to announce the new design language is live in Figma! This update comes from the One Twilio initiative to create a cohesive design language to unify Twilio‚Äôs product suite. Learn more about the work on the Twilio Blog: ‚Äú[Bringing Cohesion to the Twilio Product Suite](https://www.twilio.com/blog/bringing-cohesion-to-the-twilio-product-suite-part-i).‚Äù

Stay tuned for more news about this design language update and what product teams can expect over this year. If you have any questions about implementing in the meantime, please refer to the [Twilio Theme: Design Language Updates Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RACJwSG78YJtKMDgFY-VnbUzYyDqTae8nc3e-Y9a9Ho).

### Description List component

<ResponsiveImage src={DescriptionList} />

As product builders, we are constantly trying to find ways to organize our content within a layout that feels digestible and manageable. We want our customers to be able to quickly find the right information they need to make decisions. We now have a component that helps with organizing lots of pieces of small information at once, the Description List!

<Paragraph>
  <Anchor href="/components/description-list">Check out the Description List</Anchor>
</Paragraph>

### Form Component

<Box
  as={Image}
  maxWidth="size60"
  borderRadius="borderRadius20"
  border="1px solid lightgray"
  src={Form}
  alt=""
  style={{objectFit: 'contain'}}
/>

A Form groups related form elements that allow users to input information or configure options. This component package enhances the HTML form element with preset spacing, so forms remain visually consistent across different pages.

### File Uploader

<Box
  as={Image}
  maxWidth="size60"
  borderRadius="borderRadius20"
  border="1px solid lightgray"
  src={FileUploader}
  alt=""
  style={{objectFit: 'contain'}}
/>

The File Uploader is a visually enhanced form element that is used to upload multiple attachments. It is fully accessible and supports dragging-and-dropping attachments.

### Listbox primitive

  as={Image}
  maxWidth="size60"
  borderRadius="borderRadius20"
  border="1px solid lightgray"
  src={ListboxPrimitive}
  alt=""
  style={{objectFit: 'contain'}}
/>

The Listbox Primitive is a component used to create accessible Listboxes that can be styled to create interactive, list-based components.Listboxes can also be used in any situation where a user needs to select items in a list or rearrange a list.

## ‚ú® Pastemates‚Ñ¢ spotlight

<em>
  Pastemates are individuals and teams who have been critical contributors to Paste, through advocating for adoption
  within their products and channeling important feedback and contributions back into the system.
</em>

<Box marginBottom="space70" />

<ResponsiveImage src={Nathan} />

In this edition of Pastemates, we're spotlighting a mate from Twilio Brand, Nathan Sharp! Nathan has been such a huge support with our One Twilio efforts, and we‚Äôd like to say thanks! We‚Äôre truly grateful for our relationship with the Brand team and excited about what we will collab on next!

Nathan and the brand team have been instrumental to our One Twilio project, an initiative to evolve the product design language in order to give our customers a cohesive experience across all products.

Not only did we work across product teams to land on this design language, but it was really essential to have a close relationship with Brand, so we could ensure we were being true to Twilio‚Äôs personality.

Marketing energizes customers and invites them in, while product UI reassures customers that we‚Äôre here every step of the way to make their experience seamless.

<ResponsiveImage src={DesignLanguage} />

Finding that balance can be a tricky endeavor. However, with Nathan‚Äôs help, we were able to keep the brand personality that makes us, well, us. We started using our new super family typeface, Twilio Sans, and also collaborated on lighter color hues, thoughtful brand moments to celebrate success, more negative space, and other visual elements, to give designers tools to set a customer up for success.

We're stoked that Nathan and team were able to work with us on this initiative! If you would like to hear more about the Twilio Sans brand story, [check out Nathan's blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/introducing-twilio-sans)!

We have just created a new theme of Paste that all products using Paste can use starting later this year. If you or your teams have questions, please feel free to reach out on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/discussions) and check out the [Twilio Design Language Updates Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RACJwSG78YJtKMDgFY-VnbUzYyDqTae8nc3e-Y9a9Ho).

## Guidelines

### About icons

Icons are small graphical representation of a program or a function. They can be used to enhance the
appearance of a web interface and break up the monotony of text. Paste icons are distributed as both
SVG files and React components. Our base icon size is set to 24px. Our icon set is still limited,
we will be adding more as needed. Please [file a feature request](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/issues)
if you need an icon we don't yet have or review our [icon contribution guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a2-KAwU6dOjmcPLRD8zQln_8zS52ti7zziq_JRjUa8E).

#### Accessibility

Using an icon as the only indication of meaning is inaccessible. Different cultures may interpret the same image
in different ways and visually impaired users may not see the icon. Here are some helpful guidelines to keep in mind:

- Specify if the icon is [decorative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/) through the corresponding prop.
- If an icon isn't decorative (and thus is informative), specify a `title` prop that screenreaders can read to explain to users what the icon is about.
- Try to pair icons with text.
- Icons should not be interactive (i.e., clickable or focusable). They can be wrapped with an interactive element like [Button](/components/button) or [Anchor](/components/anchor).

### When to use icons

Use an icon only when it provides additional clarity or is necessary to draw attention to a UI element.
If an icon is used to indicate hierarchy of a UI element, all elements at the same hierarchy should also be paired with an icon.

### Examples

<LivePreview scope={{PlusIcon, LoadingIcon}} language="jsx">
  {`<div>
  <PlusIcon title="Add to cart" decorative={false} />
  <LoadingIcon decorative={true} size="sizeIcon30" iconColor="colorTextError" />
</div>`}
</LivePreview>

## Usage Guide

### API

#### Installation

```bash
yarn add @twilio-paste/icons
```

#### Usage

Icons have to be imported individually. This import style was decided for performance reasons. As our icon
set grows to contain over 100 icons, we don't want projects that use only a few icons to be burdened by
that large of a payload.

```jsx
import {PlusIcon} from '@twilio-paste/icons/esm/PlusIcon';

<Button variant="secondary" size="small" onClick={() => {}}>
  <PlusIcon decorative={true} />
  Add to cart
</Button>
```

### Implementation

#### Why SVG?

PNGs and JPGs are created using thousands of tiny pixels. SVGs are made out of geometric
primitives such as points, lines, and basic shapes. Because of this attribute, SVGs can
be resized without any loss of quality to the image. We can also write code to change SVG
attributes in realtime. These characteristics are ideal for icons since we usually want to
customize their size or color. To do this with PNGs or JPGs we would need to create a
separate file for each variation.

#### Why React components?

If you're using any Paste component, you're familiar with how to install and use a React
component. Our icon components have accessibility baked in. They also use our tokens for
sizing and coloring. With icon components, you can import only the icons your project needs.

## Guidelines

## About Alerts

Use an Alert to notify a user about high-priority or time-sensitive changes in the system. Alerts communicate system-level information that isn't triggered by a user action. To decide if an Alert is the right component, check [Alert vs. Callout vs. Toast vs. Help Text](#alert-vs-callout-vs-toast-vs-help-text).  

Use an Alert for one of these types of information:

- **Neutral or general information.** Use this in most cases where you are notifying a user of a change.
- **Warning.** Use this for critical information that will help a user avoid an issue.
- **Error.** Use this for critical information that's preventing a user from continuing a flow and if there's action required on their end to resolve the issue.

### Accessibility

- Pass in `role="alert"` or `role="status"` through [props](#props). Otherwise, the default role is `status` for neutral alerts and `alert` for warning and error alerts.
- Screen readers announce error and warning alert text immediately. Alerts that persist across multiple pages announce themselves repeatedly which may become annoying. Consider making alerts in these cases dismissible.
- Render an alert only when it's needed. Assistive technologies will be able to read a visually hidden element. Don't visually hide an alert and then make it visible through client-side code.

The Alert uses multiple methods to indicate the alert type.
- **Icon.**  The icon visually indicates the alert type, and announces the type to a screenreader.
- **Color.** Each alert type is a different color.

## Examples

<Box marginBottom="space30">
  <Alert variant="neutral">
    <strong>Martin Luther King, Jr.:</strong> We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.
  </Alert>
</Box>
<Box marginBottom="space30">
  <Alert variant="warning">
    <strong>James Baldwin:</strong> Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live
    within.
  </Alert>
</Box>
<Box marginBottom="space30">
  <Alert variant="error">
    <strong>Audre Lorde:</strong> It is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept,
    and celebrate those differences.
  </Alert>
</Box>
<Box marginBottom="space70">
  <Alert onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="warning">
    <strong>Toni Morrison:</strong> You wanna fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down.
  </Alert>
</Box>

### Neutral

Use a neutral alert to notify a user of a change that's relevant for them to achieve their current goal. Don't use an alert to communicate general promotional information.

In most cases, a neutral alert should be dismissible (_i.e._, have a close button) and should be assigned `role="status"`.

You may use [the Text primitive](/primitives/text) as a child of Alert, but if you do, be sure to pass `color="inherit"` for neutral alerts.

<Blockquote
  name="Nielsen Norman Group"
  source="Indicators, Validations, and Notifications"
  sourceUrl="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/indicators-validations-notifications/"
>
  A notification sent irrespective of the current user goal would likely be ignored, and may even annoy users because it
  will disrupt their current task and be irrelevant to their current needs.
</Blockquote>

<LivePreview scope={{Alert, Text, Anchor}} language="jsx">
  {`<Alert variant="neutral">
    <strong>Set up your contact preferences.</strong> You can now set up your contact preferences on your dashboard. <Anchor href="#">Go to contact preferences</Anchor>
</Alert>`}
</LivePreview>

### Warning

Use a warning Alert to help a user avoid an issue. 

A warning Alert should provide explain the possible issue, what to do, and what happens if they don't. If the user can take an immediate action, provide a way to do it. 

Be cautious about using a warning alert because they can be stressful for a user to see. In most cases, a warning alert should be assigned `role="alert"`.

You may use [the Text primitive](/primitives/text) as a child of Alert, but if you do, be sure to pass `color="inherit"` for warning alerts.

<LivePreview scope={{Alert, Text}} language="jsx">
  {`<Alert variant="warning">
    <strong>Some information on this page may be out-of-date.</strong> This page was last updated at 9:00 AM PST. We're currently looking into this issue.
</Alert>`}
</LivePreview>

### Error

Use an error Alert to help a user understand a critical issue at the system level, like site-wide service disruptions, active incidents, or expired billing information. When possible, provide a way to resolve the issue in the alert.

In most cases, error Alerts should be assigned `role="alert"`.

For additional guidance on what kind of component to use, use the [Alert vs. Callout vs. Toast vs. Help Text guide](#alert-vs-callout-vs-toast-vs-help-text). For additional guidance on how to compose error messages, refer to the [error state pattern](/patterns/error-state).

You may use [the Text primitive](/primitives/text) as a child of Alert, but if you do, be sure to pass `color="inherit"` for error alerts.

<LivePreview scope={{Alert, Text, Anchor}} language="jsx">
  {`<Alert variant="error">
    <strong>Please update your billing information or we'll suspend your account on March 2.</strong> We couldn't renew your subscription with the information we currently have. <Anchor href="#">Update billing information</Anchor>
</Alert>`}
</LivePreview>

### Dismissible

Add a close button to the alert if it doesn't communicate a persistent status of the system or the account. If you make an alert dismissible, provide another way for the user to retrieve the alert information.

Don't add a close button to the alert if all these conditions are true:

- The alert communicates a persistent status of the system or the account.
- The information is relevant to the user's goals on the page(s) the alert is on.
- The user wouldn't be able to access the information in the alert if it were closed.

Keep in mind that the longer an alert is present, the more it starts looking like part of the page and loses its interruptive intent. This might make users start to ignore important alert information.

<LivePreview scope={{Alert, Text, Anchor}} language="jsx">
  {`<Alert onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="neutral">
    We've enabled new security options for your account. <Anchor href="#">Learn more</Anchor>
</Alert>`}
</LivePreview>

### Internationalization

To internationalize an Alert, simply pass different text as children.
The only exceptions to this are the labels for both the dismiss button and the variant icons.
To change the dismiss button&apos;s label text, use the `i18nDismissLabel` prop.
To change the label of a variant's icon, use the matching i18n prop for the variant.
For an `error` variant, for example, set the `i18nErrorLabel` prop.

<LivePreview scope={{Alert, Text}} language="jsx">
  {`<Alert onDismiss={() => alert('fermée')} variant="warning" i18nWarningLabel="(avertissement)">
  C&apos;est une alerte d&apos;avertissement.
</Alert>`}
</LivePreview>

## Composition notes

Keep alert content brief by placing only the highest priority information in an alert. A good rule of thumb is to keep alert text to a single line in a desktop-sized container, or [limit it to 90 characters](https://practicaltypography.com/responsive-web-design.html).

Compose an alert with:

- **Title (optional).** Bold the text at the beginning of the alert. The title should be concise and convey the essence of the issue.
- **Body text.** Use the default text style. Limit body text to 1-2 sentences and do not repeat information contained in a title. Explain what happened, and if something is wrong, how to fix it. When possible, include what happens if they don't take action. If the resolution requires going to a different page, include an [Anchor](/components/anchor). Use [Buttons](/components/button) sparingly, since they may compete with other [Buttons](/components/button) on the screen. Only use a small [Button](/components/button) if it will trigger an action.
- **Full punctuation.** Use periods after full sentences. Avoid using exclamation points.

Active voice is generally preferred (for example, "You updated the API."). However, passive voice is acceptable for alerts related to whether a system action occured or not (for example, "API was updated.").

### Alert vs. Callout vs. Toast vs. Help Text

Alert

- Alerts communicate information relevant at the system level.
- Do not use an Alert in response to user action.

[Callout](/components/callout)

- Callouts communicate information particular to a section of a page, or information that applies to a whole page.
- Use a Callout when there are multiple pieces of information to convey. For example, an error summary.
- Callouts can result from a user action, but don’t have to. Therefore, they can include either static or contextual content.

[Toast](/components/toast)

- Toasts communicate brief, easily comprehended messages.
- Toasts generally result from a user action.
- If the message is contextual or specific to a particular part of a page, consider Help Text or a Callout.
- Do not use a Toast if the message is longer than two sentences (~140 characters). Use a Callout instead.
- Do not use a Toast if there is more than one anchor or button. Use a Callout instead.

[Help Text](/components/help-text)

- Help Text communicates contextual responses.
- Help Text can result from a user action, but don’t have to.

### Placement and behavior

Place an alert where it makes the most contextual sense. Don't cover other UI elements with an alert.

In general, the persistence and behavior on scroll of an alert should match the element it's scoped to. For example, if an alert is scoped to a navigation bar that is sticky on scroll and persists across several pages, the alert should similarly be sticky and persist across several pages. However, don't persist the alert across too many pages in a user session since it may lose its interruptive intent.

## Self-service support

### Content checklist

How do you know when your content is "done" or "good"?

#### The tone is appropriate to the scenario.

- A stressful scenario is managed empathetically, with knowledgable and encouraging tone. Reassure and inform the user clearly.
- A win or success is managed genuinely, with a positive and encouraging tone. Celebrate with the user genuinely.
- A repeated interaction is managed efficiently, with a positive and conversational tone. Support the user's flow by reducing friction.

#### The content meets the user's immediate needs.

- The user has enough information to understand context, the impact of an action/decision, and clarity over what happens next.

#### The words and structure are as simple as they can be.

- You've replaced jargon with a simpler term or explained technical language/acronyms.
- Sentences are short.

#### The message is clear and unambiguous.

- Your content can only be interpreted one way.
- You've replaced any vague or imprecise language with precise, clear terms.

#### You've checked it. Twice.

- Capitals, punctuation, and spelling all align with this guide.
- Tip: Read it out loud to yourself. If it doesn't "sound right", consider changing the wording or phrasing.

#### Someone unfamiliar with the project has read and understood it.

- Ask them to read it out loud, then tell you what it means.
- If their understanding matches your intent, great! Your content is clear.
- If they stumble on words or don't understand, ask why. Use their feedback to iterate, then try again.

## UX Writer support

### Content Support Request

Submit a [Content Support Request](http://tiny.cc/csrf2020) to receive asynchronous or 121 support from Caroline, Sr UX Writer.

#### Types of support available

- **Copy edit** To check grammar, style, and sense. Useful if you feel the content is >80% ready, you have checked it thoroughly, and implemented peers' feedback.
- **Content review** To make it more effective, plus check grammar, style, and sense. Useful if you feel the content is not improving with feedback, it needs to be more concise, or there’s a specific aspect you feel needs support.
- **Working session (30-60mins)** To discuss an upcoming project, or challenging content in progress. Useful if you want to flag a future need, discuss specific issues, or tackle tricky feedback.

#### How requests are handled

- Requests are reviewed and prioritized before each sprint.
- You'll be notified when the request has been accepted and scheduled.
- Last-minute requests do not take automatic priority. Please plan ahead. (It's never to early to think about content.)

### New project and feature support

Kicking off a content-heavy project or feature? Submit a [Content Support Request](http://tiny.cc/csrf2020) for a 30-min 121 to discuss it.

The earlier you register a need (even a future need), the easier it is to schedule in time for content support at the appropriate time for you and the project.

### Slack

Reach out to Caroline Tecks on Slack if

- You're not sure what kind of support you need.
- You have an unavoidable, urgent request. (Last-minute requests won't be automatically prioritized.)

### Content office hours

Coming soon - timing and frequency are TBC.

For now, please submit a Content Support Request, or come to the EMEA-friendly Design Systems office hours.
Caroline will be there to help in the moment, or take your query offline for support.

## Prompts to guide review

**This section is in development.** You can use these questions either as prompts when you're self-editing or as a framework for reviewing others' content.

#### What is the user’s goal or need? What information do they need to make progress?

- We rely on our limited short-term memory to read and understand.
- Long sentences packed with information are difficult to comprehend quickly.
- Don’t overload users with unnecessary information or things they’ll need to remember.
- Give the user the information they need when they need it, not before.

#### How can this content improve the user’s experience?

- We can create positive responses by making the user feel supported, confident, and in control.
- Reducing friction and cognitive load makes a repeated flow feel effortless.
- Celebrating with the user makes infrequent successes (a first-time set up, for example) feel special.
- Communicating a clear action and outcome in an error or alert makes an anxious moment feel manageable.

#### Does this content clearly communicate what the user will experience or needs to do next?

- Too much or too little information can cause anxiety.
- Set the user’s expectation with clear and precise words.
- If you feel you need to write a complex message to explain outcomes or exceptions, rethink the flow.
- Not sure what happens next? Find out.
- Don’t try to solve design or engineering problems with words.

#### How can any vague or ambiguous language be made more precise?

- If we’re guessing at the content and its meaning, so will the user.
- Words like _probably, might, could, seems, some, many_, or _a few_ indicate ambiguities.
- The user’s primary concern is "How can I do what I need to?" Answer that efficiently first.
- Only add details if the user needs them to understand or progress.
- If you’re not sure which word to use, ask or test variations.

#### Does this content give the user the information they need, even if it’s not positive news?

- Be clear and transparent about the immediate effect of an error, the action required, and its impact.
- It’s very rarely appropriate to make jokes or be coy when delivering bad news &mdash; don’t.
- Inform and reassure. If the user needs to complete an additional step, adding "please" shows empathy.

## 🙌 Thank you to our H1 2022 Committee!

The Design Systems Committee is made up of designers and engineers from
a wide variety of teams who regularly use Paste and provide insight and
feedback on the system. Over the past six months, Committee members have
reviewed Badge, Multi-select Combobox, the Data Visualization library,
and much more. Their input has been invaluable in the progression of
Twilio’s Design System, and we on the UX Infrastructure team are
incredibly grateful for their participation!

If you’re interested in becoming a part of the Design Systems Committee
for the next half of the year, please reach out to [Loreina Chew](mailto:lchew@twilio.com).

## 🚀 What's new

### Paste Intellisense

<ResponsiveImage src={PasteIntellisense} alt="Screenshot of the Paste Intellisense plugin being used in VS Code" />

Engineers, get ready for your lives to become a whole lot easier! <b>Gapur Kassym</b> from the Frontline team recently developed and contributed an exciting new tool: a VS Code extension
that allows the user to easily view the pixel or rem value of a design token.
[Paste Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gapur.twilio-paste-intellisense) populates a list of suggestions in a drop-down menu for autocompleting tokens, and it also shows the actual value
of a token on hover. We’re thrilled to see this design tooling contribution come to life as we incorporate it into the Paste
monorepo!

### Textarea component can now be resized!

<ResponsiveImage src={TextArea} alt="Paste textarea component with label and help text showing the resize option" />

We recently released a major update to Paste (v14.0.0) to upgrade our Textarea component. It no longer has a dependency on `react-autosize-textarea` and instead has a peerDependency on `@twilio-paste/react-textarea-autosize-library` (which is bundled in `@twilio-paste/core`). The reason we changed this is to add a new resize prop, which defaults to ‘none’ and allows vertical. This prop allows users to resize the Textarea to whatever height they want.

### One Twilio blog post

  alt="Text on a blue background reading 'Bringing Cohesion to the Twilio Product Suite; Part I"
/>

The One Twilio team wrote a blog post about the research phase of their initiative to bring cohesion to Twilio’s full product suite. The post was published on [Twilio’s blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/bringing-cohesion-to-the-twilio-product-suite-part-i) and was featured in [Issue 133 of Design Systems News](https://news.design.systems/issues/133).

Give it a read if you’d like to learn more about the customer research, market analysis, and ecosystem audits that the team tackled to set a strong foundation for the design work to come.

### Emotion updated to version 11

<ResponsiveImage src={Emotion} alt="Screenshot of the emotion 11 upgrade PR in github" />

We recently released a major update to Paste in order to upgrade [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), the style library on which Paste is built. Make sure to upgrade the version of `@twilio-paste/core` you’re using when convenient, and [keep an eye on the changelog](/core/changelog/) to make sure you don’t miss any future releases. If you’re curious about the changes that came along with version 11 of Emotion, [read about them on the Emotion docs](https://emotion.sh/docs/emotion-11).

### We updated our NextJS starter template

<ResponsiveImage src={Nextjs} alt="NextJS logo" />

Starting a brand new project with Paste and NextJS? [Our starter template](/introduction/for-engineers/quickstart/#using-create-next-app) can get you up and running in no time! We’ve recently updated the template to use the latest version of NextJS so you can spin-up a project on the cutting edge. This version drops support for Node v12, so make sure you’re up to date in your Node versions. As always, if you encounter any issues, [reach out to let us know](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/discussions).

## ⚡ Pastemates™

<em>
  Pastemates are individuals and teams who have been critical contributors to Paste, through advocating for adoption
  within their products and channeling important feedback and contributions back into the system.
</em>

<ResponsiveImage src={Gapur} alt="This month's Pastemate, Gapur Kassym" />

We’re excited and inspired by this Pastemate’s contribution. Gapur Kassym from the Frontline team created a VS Code extension that blew us all away! [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (aka VS Code) is a dev environment that allows for customization through extensions, and Gapur’s [Paste Intellisense extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gapur.twilio-paste-intellisense) allows developers to more easily use Paste in their projects. Gapur’s work uses autocomplete and hover features to show the name and value of Paste’s design tokens as they’re used in the code. By integrating this knowledge into the development space, Gapur has made a tool with the potential to simplify and empower all builders who use Paste! He recently demoed the extension for us and told us about his ideas for future features, so stay tuned! He lived all four values of the [Twilio Magic 2.0](https://switchboard.twilio.com/sites/all-about-us/SitePageModern/13749/twilio-magic-2-0), and we can’t wait to add his contribution to our system soon. Thank you, Gapur!

        <strong>Paste goes international</strong>

      <Td>
        🟢 Paste now fully supports Twilio’s internationalization efforts for Q1. Paste components are capable of
        supporting translated content and do not rely on any hard-coded strings.

      </Td>
      <Td>
        🟢 We’ve been in visual concept land! During ThinkWeek, we diverged to come up with visual directions for an
        evolved design language for Twilio. Post ThinkWeek, we converged on a few directions that we’ll be getting
        feedback on from our RAPID. From there, we’ll refine the directions and pursue user testing to help us move
        towards one visual direction.

        Because of the company’s recent initiatives to focus on resiliency work, we’ve decided to pause this BPM. This
        means that we’ll be able to devote more energy towards the priorities that provide direct customer value and
        align more closely with the company’s current focus.

## Guidelines

## About Toast

Use a toast to communicate a direct response to a user based on their action. Using a toast lets users know that their action was acknowledged.

Toasts appear over content on a page and stack vertically. All toasts have a close button so that users can dismiss any toasts that may be blocking underlying page content.

Use a toast for one of these types of responses:

- **Success.** Confirm a successful or completed action.
- **Warning.** Help a user avoid a future issue that might happen based on their action. If the user can take an immediate action to avoid the issue, provide a way to do that. In most cases, a warning toast lets users know that their current action was successful but may have triggered a related issue.
- **Error.** Communicate an issue that's preventing a user from completing their current action.
- **Neutral or general response.** Let a user know that an asynchronous process has been triggered based on their action, especially if they have to wait for the process to finish before continuing a workflow. This could include a large download or a request that's been sent to a third party.

In general, use Toasts for response to user action. To decide whether you should a Toast, refer to the [Alerts vs. Callouts vs. Toasts vs. Help Text guide](#alert-vs-callout-vs-toast-vs-help-text).

### Responsive Toast

We've exposed the `left` prop on Toaster and Toast Container so that you can use your app's breakpoints to set the placement of your Toasts.

```jsx
import {Toast, Toaster, ToastContainer} from '@twilio-paste/core/toast';

const ToastWithToaster = () => {
  const toaster = useToaster();
  return <Toaster left={['space40', 'unset', 'unset']} {...toaster} />;
};

const ToastWithContainer = () => {
  return (
    <ToastContainer left={['space40', 'unset', 'unset']}>
      <Toast>I am toast</Toast>
    </ToastContainer>
  );
};
```

### Accessibility

If you make a [toast automatically time out](#showing-dismissing-and-timing-out-a-toast), consider users that have different reading speeds, vision levels, and literacy levels (more details in the research insight below).

We recommend giving users about 500 milliseconds per word. For short toasts (about 5–10 words), give users about 2,000–4,000 milliseconds to read the toast message. For toasts at our [max suggested length of 140 characters](#composition-notes), that's about 30,000 milliseconds for about 55 English words. In this case, consider not making the toast automatically time out since the longer content length could suggest that there's information worth persisting for the customer.

In addition to reading time, consider the time users need to make a decision based on the message. If a toast has any interactive element in it, like a link or button, don't add an automatic time-out to the toast.

<Callout variant="neutral" marginY="space70">
  <CalloutHeading as="h4">Research insight into reading speeds</CalloutHeading>
  <CalloutText>
    From the{' '}
    <Anchor href="https://www.perkinselearning.org/technology/blog/reading-rates">Perkins School for the Blind</Anchor>:
    Reading rates are 1.5–2 times slower for people with low vision compared to those with sighted vision. If we take an
    8th grade reading level at 197 words per minute (wpm), we can suggest a 131 wpm reading rate.

    suggests that reading rates for adults with dyslexia or increased age are similar or slightly higher.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

Don't use toasts to communicate dynamically changing content, including progress bars. Since toasts have ARIA `role=status`, they'll need to trigger a status update to assistive technology, such as screen readers, each time the content changes, which could get annoying. Use a [non-modal dialog](/primitives/non-modal-dialog-primitive), [modal](/components/modal), or show the changing content on the underlying page instead.

## Examples

Here are ways that you can compose neutral, warning, error, success, and dismissible toasts.

<Box marginBottom="space80">
  <Stack orientation="vertical" spacing="space40">
    <Toast onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="neutral">
      <strong>Martin Luther King, Jr.:</strong> We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.
    </Toast>
    <Toast onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="warning">
      <strong>James Baldwin:</strong> Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live
      within.
    </Toast>
    <Toast onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="error">
      <strong>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie:</strong> Racism should never have happened and so you don't get a cookie for
      reducing it.
    </Toast>
    <Toast onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="success">
      <strong>Toni Morrison:</strong> You wanna fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down.
    </Toast>
  </Stack>
</Box>

### Showing, dismissing, and timing out a toast

The Toaster is a convenient way to manage showing and dismissing Toasts. The Toaster comes in two parts:

- A `useToaster` hook that handles adding, removing, auto dismissing and state.
- A `<Toaster />` component that handles rendering toasts into the DOM.

#### useToaster hook

The easiest way to use the Toaster is to use the `useToaster` hook. It will handle adding and removing a Toast and can be used to set automatic time-outs. The `useToaster` hook will then return the props needed to render the Toasts within the `Toaster` component.

`useToaster` returns 3 things:

- An array of `toasts` to be rendered in the DOM.
- A `push` method used to add a Toast to the Toaster.
- A `pop` method used to remove a Toast from the Toaster via its ID.

Below is a form you can use to create toasts dynamically using the Toaster. The form data is used to `push` a new Toast to the Toaster.

<Box marginBottom="space70">
  <Card>
    <ToasterExample />
  </Card>
</Box>

##### Adding a Toast

You can push a Toast to the Toaster stack based on any action or event. In this example it's based on a button click:

```
const MyComponent = () => {
  const toaster = useToaster();

  const handleClick = () => {
    toaster.push({
      message: 'Selection was successfully saved to your profile',
      variant: 'success',
    })
  }

  return(
    <>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={handleClick}>
        Add a toast
      </Button>
      <Toaster left={['space40', 'unset', 'unset']} {...toaster} />
    </>
  )
}
```

##### Removing a Toast

You can optionally provide an `id` to a toast when you push it to the stack. The ID can then be used to programmatically `pop` the Toast from the stack:

```
toaster.push({
  message: 'Selection was successfully saved to your profile',
  variant: 'success',
  id: 'custom_id',
})

toaster.pop('custom_id')
```

When providing your own custom ID, make sure they are unique.

##### Automatic dismissal

You can optionally provide a time-out to a toast, after which the Toast is automatically dismissed. This can be done by setting a `dismissAfter` value. The value must be a valid time-out, set in milliseconds.

```
toaster.push({
  message: 'Selection was successfully saved to your profile',
  variant: 'success',
  id: 'custom_id',
  dismissAfter: 4000
})
```

Add an automatic time-out if all these conditions are true:

- The user wouldn't need to remember or copy the information in order to continue with their current flow, or any future flow.
- The toast doesn't have any interactive content, such as a link or button.

We recommend giving users about 500 milliseconds per word before timing out a toast.

#### Toaster component

The `<Toaster />` component handles rendering the toasts it is passed via props. It handles how the Toast enters and leaves the UI.

If you pass it the returned state of the `useToaster` hook, state, pushing, popping, and handling browser window time-outs is taken care of for you.

```jsx
const toaster = useToaster();

return <Toaster left={['space40', 'unset', 'unset']} {...toaster} />;
```

### Neutral Toast

Use a neutral Toast to communicate that a background process was triggered based on their action, especially if they have to wait for the process to finish before continuing a flow.

You may use [the Text primitive](/primitives/text) as a child of Toast, but if you do, be sure to pass `color="inherit"` for neutral toasts.

<LivePreview scope={{Toast}} language="jsx">
  {`<Toast onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="neutral">
    Your function is currently being deployed.
</Toast>`}
</LivePreview>

### Success Toast

Use a success toast to confirm a successful or completed action. If a creation flow is a 2-step process—a user creates an object, then edits the details of that object—confirm the completion after each step with a toast.

Provide an "undo" action in the toast if it's easily and safely reversible, and you're able to take the user back to their previous state. For example, you can allow the user to undo an action through a toast if:

- They submitted a short form that updates something. Undoing the action can take them back to their filled form with any sensitive fields cleared.

- They deleted non-sensitive information we'd want them to easily retrieve.

You may use [the Text primitive](/primitives/text) as a child of Toast, but if you do, be sure to pass `color="inherit"` for success toasts.

<LivePreview scope={{Toast, Anchor}} language="jsx">
  {`<Toast onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="success">
    Your email address has been updated. You can view your profile <Anchor href="#">here</Anchor>.
</Toast>`}
</LivePreview>

<Callout variant="neutral" marginY="space70">
  <CalloutHeading as="h4">When to automatically time-out a success toast</CalloutHeading>
  <CalloutText>
    Add an automatic time-out to a success toast if the <i>only</i> thing it does is confirm that the action was
    completed. If it has any additional information or interactive content, like a link or button, the toast shouldn't
    time-out.
  </CalloutText>
  <CalloutText>
    Anecdotal data from product designers have also suggested that some Twilio customers find it annoying to have to
    manually close success toasts.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

### Warning Toast

Use a warning toast to help a user avoid a potential future issue that might happen based on their action. If the user can take an immediate action to avoid the issue, provide a way to do that. In most cases, a warning toast lets users know that their current action completed but may have triggered a related issue.

Be cautious when using a warning toast because they can be stressful for a user to see. If the information you're trying to convey is not very critical, consider using a neutral toast instead.

You may use [the Text primitive](/primitives/text) as a child of Toast, but if you do, be sure to pass `color="inherit"` for warning toasts.

<LivePreview scope={{Toast, Anchor}} language="jsx">
  {`<Toast onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="warning">
    The phone number has been deleted. Functions still using this phone number may fail. Verify there are no functions tied to that number <Anchor href="#">here</Anchor>.
</Toast>`}
</LivePreview>

### Error Toast

Use an error toast to communicate a brief, easily comprehended issue that's preventing them from completing their current action. Error toasts should communicate issues that are not the user's fault. Provide a way to resolve the issue either in the underlying page content or in the toast.

Consider using a Callout instead if:

- The issue or the resolution require more than two short sentences.
- The error is specific to a particular part of the page, since Toasts do not appear in contextually relevant locations on the page.

Never allow an error toast to automatically time out.

For additional guidance on how to compose error messages, refer to the [error state pattern](/patterns/error-state).

You may use [the Text primitive](/primitives/text) as a child of Toast, but if you do, be sure to pass `color="inherit"` for error toasts.

<LivePreview scope={{Toast}} language="jsx">
  {`<Toast onDismiss={() => alert('dismissed')} variant="error">
    There was an error when deleting the profile. Please try again.
</Toast>`}
</LivePreview>

### Internationalization

To internationalize a toast, simply pass different text as children to the toast.
The only exceptions to this are the labels for both the dismiss button and the variant icons.
To change the dismiss button&apos;s label text, use the `i18nDismissLabel` prop.
To change the label of a variant's icon, use the matching i18n prop for the variant.
For a `success` variant, for example, set the `i18nSuccessLabel` prop.

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    Toast,
  }}
  noInline
>
  {i18nExample}
</LivePreview>

## Composition Notes

Keep toast text brief, scannable, and specific to the current user action. Only include the highest priority information and aim for no more than 140 characters. Success toasts generally run about 50 characters long, while all other alerts might run about 100 characters long.

Compose a Toast with:

- **Title (optional)**. Bold the text at the beginning of the Toast. The title should be concise and convey the essence of the issue.
- **Body text**. Use the default text style. Do not repeat information contained in a title.
- **Full punctuation.** Use periods after full sentences. Avoid using exclamation points.

If the user needs to take action on another page, or more information would be helpful to them, use an [Anchor](/components/anchor). Be cautious about using a button in a toast since it should be used only to trigger an action. If you must use a button, use a [small secondary button](/components/button#small-button).

### Alert vs. Callout vs. Toast vs. Help Text

Alert

- Alerts communicate information relevant at the system level.
- Do not use Alerts in response to user action.

Callout

- Callouts communicate information particular to a section of a page, or information that applies to a whole page.
- Use a Callout when there are multiple pieces of information to convey. For example, an error summary.
- Callouts can result from a user action, but don’t have to. Therefore, they can include either static or contextual content.

Toast

- Toasts communicate brief, easily comprehended messages.
- Toasts generally result from a user action.
- If the message is contextual or specific to a particular part of a page, consider Help Text or a Callout.
- Do not use a Toast if the message is longer than two sentences (~140 characters). Use a Callout instead.
- Do not use a Toast if there is more than one anchor or button. Use a Callout instead.

Help Text

- Help Text communicates contextual responses.
- Help Text can result from a user action, but don’t have to.

## When to use a Toast

Do not show more than 3 toasts at a time. If more than 3 could appear at a time, show only one toast that summarizes the information.

<DoDont>
  <Do
    title="Do"
    body="Allow toasts to persist on a page until a user closes them, especially if the toast has a link or button. Success toasts are an exception. Add an automatic time-out to a success toast if the only thing it does is confirm that the action was completed."
    preview={false}
  />
  <Dont title="Don't" body="Don't add an automatic time-out to a toast if it has a link or button." preview={false} />
</DoDont>

<DoDont>
  <Do title="Do" body="Show only one toast in response to a single user action." preview={false} />
  <Dont
    title="Don't"
    body="Avoid putting users in scenarios where more than three toasts could show at once. If you need to use more than three, consider batching them."
    preview={false}
  />
</DoDont>

<DoDont>
  <Do
    title="Do"
    body="Use a toast to communicate a single, focused text status update."
    preview={false}
  />
  <Dont title="Don't" body="Don't use toasts to communicate dynamically changing content, including progress bars. Use a non-modal dialog, modal, or show the changing content on the underlying page instead." preview={false} />

</DoDont>

## Usage Guide

### API

#### Installation

```bash
yarn add @twilio-paste/toast - or - yarn add @twilio-paste/core
```

#### Usage

```jsx
import {Toast, Toaster} from '@twilio-paste/core/toast';

const Component = () => {
  const toaster = useToaster();
  return <Toaster left={['space40', 'unset', 'unset']} {...toaster} />;
};
```

##### Toaster component

If you choose to handle state entirely yourself, you can use `<Toaster />` on its own, but you are fully responsible for handling state, time-outs, and the dismiss functionality.

```
<Toaster
  left={['space40', 'unset', 'unset']}
  toasts={[{
    id: '',
    message: '',
    variant: ''
    dismissAfter: ''
  }]}
  pop={(id) =>{
    // called when a toast is dismissed
  }}
/>
```

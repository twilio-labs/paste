## Guidelines

### About the Disclosure Primitive

The Disclosure primitive is an unstyled, functional version of a Disclosure.
It can be used to build a component following the [WAI-ARIA Disclosure](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#disclosure)
pattern. Our Disclosure component is built on top of this primitive.

These unstyled primitives are to be used when the styled Disclosure provided by Paste
doesn’t meet the requirements needed to solve a unique customer problem. At that
point, you are welcome to fallback to this functional primitive to roll your own
styled disclosure while still providing a functional and accessible experience to
your customers.

This primitive should be used to compose all custom Disclosures to ensure
accessibility and upgrade paths.

<Callout variant="warning">
  <CalloutTitle>Warning</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    We strongly suggest that all components built on top of this primitive get reviewed by the Design Systems team and
    goes through the UX Review process to ensure an excellent experience for our customers.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

## Usage Guide

This package is a wrapper around [Reakit's Disclosure](https://reakit.io/docs/menu/).
If you’re wondering why we wrapped that package into our own, we reasoned that
it would be best for our consumers’ developer experience. For example:

- We can control which APIs we expose and how to expose them. For example, in this package we rename
  and export only some of the source package's exports.
- If we want to migrate the underlying nuts and bolts in the future, Twilio products that
  depend on this primitive would need to replace all occurrences of `import … from ‘@reach/dialog’`
  to `import … from ‘@some-new/package’`. By wrapping it in `@twilio-paste/disclosure-primitive`,
  this refactor can be avoided. The only change would be a version bump in the package.json file.
- We can more strictly enforce semver and backwards compatibility than some of our dependencies.
- We can control when to provide an update and which versions we allow, to help reduce
  potential bugs our consumers may face.

### Installation

This package is available individually or as part of `@twilio-paste/core`.

```
yarn add @twilio-paste/disclosure-primitive - or - yarn add @twilio-paste/core
```

### Examples

#### Basic Example

<LivePreview scope={{useDisclosurePrimitiveState, DisclosurePrimitive, DisclosurePrimitiveContent}} language="jsx">
  {BasicExample}
</LivePreview>

#### Conditional Rendering Example

You shouldn't conditionally render the DisclosurePrimitiveContent component as
this will make some Reakit features not work. Instead, you can use render
props and conditionally render the underneath element:

<LivePreview scope={{useDisclosurePrimitiveState, DisclosurePrimitive, DisclosurePrimitiveContent}} language="jsx">
  {ConditionallyRenderingExample}
</LivePreview>

#### Multiple Components

Each DisclosurePrimitiveContent component should have its own `useDisclosureState`.
This is also true for derivative modules like Dialog, Popover, Menu, Tooltip etc.

If you want to have only one DisclosurePrimitive element controling multiple `DisclosurePrimitiveContent`
components, you can use render props to apply the same state to different
Disclosures that will result in a single element.

<LivePreview scope={{useDisclosurePrimitiveState, DisclosurePrimitive, DisclosurePrimitiveContent}} language="jsx">
  {MultipleExample}
</LivePreview>

    cadence, we're duplicating the docs here to prevent information fragmentation.

#### useDisclosurePrimitiveState Props

All the regular HTML attributes (`role`, `aria-*`, `type`, and so on) including the following custom props:

| Prop      | Type              | Default |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| baseId?   | string            |         |
| visible?  | bool              |         |
| animated? | number or boolean |         |

##### `baseId` prop

ID that will serve as a base for all the items IDs.

##### `visible` prop

Whether it's visible or not.

##### `animated` prop

If true, animating will be set to true when visible is updated. It'll wait
for stopAnimation to be called or a CSS transition ends. If animated is set
to a number, stopAnimation will be called only after the same number of
milliseconds have passed.

#### DisclosurePrimitive Props

All the regular HTML attributes (`role`, `aria-*`, `type`, and so on) including the following custom props:

| Prop       | Type    | Default |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| disabled?  | boolean |         |
| focusable? | boolean |         |

##### `disabled` prop

Same as the HTML attribute.

##### `focusable` prop

When an element is `disabled`, it may still be `focusable`. It works
similarly to `readOnly` on form elements. In this case, only
`aria-disabled` will be set.

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle>State props</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    These props are returned by the state hook. You can spread them into this component ({`...state`}) or pass them
    separately. You can also provide these props from your own state logic.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

| Prop    | Type       | Default |
| ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| visible | boolean    |         |
| baseId  | boolean    |         |
| toggle  | () => void |         |

##### `baseId` prop

ID that will serve as a base for all the items IDs.

##### `visible` prop

Whether it's visible or not.

##### `toggle` prop

Toggles the visible state

#### DisclosurePrimitiveContent Props

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle>State props</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    These props are returned by the state hook. You can spread them into this component ({`...state`}) or pass them
    separately. You can also provide these props from your own state logic.

| baseId        | boolean           |         |
| animated      | number or boolean |         |
| animating     | boolean           |         |

##### `baseId` prop

ID that will serve as a base for all the items IDs.

##### `visible` prop

Whether it's visible or not.

##### `animated` prop

If true, animating will be set to true when visible is updated. It'll wait
for stopAnimation to be called or a CSS transition ends. If animated is set
to a number, stopAnimation will be called only after the same number of
milliseconds have passed.

##### `animating` prop

Whether it's animating or not.

##### `stopAnimation` prop

Stops animation. It's called automatically if there's a CSS transition.

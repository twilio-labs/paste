## Introduction

Self-service tips on how to build experiences in a way that’s appropriate and meaningful to all our customers, no matter where they are in the world.

### Definition of terms

  audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.
</p>
<h4 aria-describedby="internationalization">Localization</h4>
<p id="internationalization">

  of a specific target market/locale.
</p>
<h4 aria-describedby="internationalization">Translation</h4>
<p id="internationalization">
  Converting text from one language to another. Not to be confused with localization, translation is just one part of
  localizing a product.
</p>
<h4 aria-describedby="internationalization">Locale</h4>
<p id="internationalization">
  A linguistic region defined by both its language and country. Please note that languages and countries won’t always
  have a 1:1 mapping.

## General guidelines

### Leave blank space around condensed UI components

Leave blank space around condensed UI components, such as popovers, buttons, and tabs to prevent unexpected line breaks.

- For some languages, text is up to 30% longer on average than English.
- If text gets truncated or has line-breaks at wrong places could lead to grammatical errors and design breaks.
- Make all UI components expandable (auto-layout).
- Don’t assign fixed-width or height to UI components, unless there’s a strong.

### Keep links short and descriptive

- Don’t use full/long phrases as links, as these might break into different parts when translated.
- Assume all words in a phrase or sentence will change order when translated.
- Use only one, descriptive term or a short part of a phrase.

### Order in components matter

Avoid creating UI sentences. If the layout and functionality of your interface is dependent on a certain word order, it’s likely to break when localized.

### Avoid forced capitalization

- Avoid setting a single capitalization design rule that fits all languages.
  - In French, Italian, and Spanish (among others) only the first letter should be capitalized for certain words.
  - In German (P1), certain types of nouns, gerunds, and names must start with upper-case.
- Developers should avoid using CSS (text-transform: capitalize) to handle capitalization.

### Avoid flags to represent languages

- Use flags only to represent countries and not to represent languages.
- Always write the name of the language instead of using a flag.

### Avoid text on images

- If text over images is needed, overlay it by code, using HTML and CSS.

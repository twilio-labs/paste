The components listed here are on our roadmap.  Only a few of them are available today.

If you’re planning on using an alpha or beta component, please check in with the Paste team through the <strong>#help-design-system</strong> channel on Slack.

Don't see a component you need listed here? [Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/issues), and we'll evaluate it. Not all component
requests are accepted for the design system. We’ll have guidelines soon for what to do if your component isn’t
supported.


<ComponentOverviewTable componentsList={props.data.allPasteComponent.edges} />

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  {
    allPasteComponent {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          version
          status
        }
      }
    }
  }

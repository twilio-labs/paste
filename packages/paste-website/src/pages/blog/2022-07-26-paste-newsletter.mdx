## 📣 What's new in Paste

### The new tokens page is live!

<Paragraph>
  <Image src={TokensPage} />
</Paragraph>

We are extremely excited to announce that we have released a new version of the tokens list page! It has a streamlined and improved design with the ability to search through token names and values, quick copy buttons for each token, and switch between JavaScript and CSS formats. You can also watch our [walkthrough of the new features](https://www.loom.com/share/6ac6db3e5120442293c7d151d454f272).

We hope that you find the new tokens page easier to use. Please [send us any feedback and suggestions](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/discussions) about how we can continue making our site work better for you.

### Figma Slot components

<ResponsiveImage src={FigmaSlots} />

On July 28th, there was a big Figma release that introduced the concept of Slots. Slots are placeholder components that can be nested inside container components. They’re intentionally empty so that you can swap them out for your own custom content. It’s now easier for you to place custom content inside of existing Paste container components (e.g. Card, Modal, Disclosure, etc.) without having to detach them! It’s as easy as swapping out variants.

We’ve been quietly releasing components in the Chat Log package for the Conversations UI Kit and they’re finally ready for the big time! More components and documentation are coming next release, so watch this space!

### The Form Pill Group gets a design update

<ResponsiveImage src={FormPill} />

Form Pill Group has new and improved styles for each state. We’ve introduced a new error variant, added support for disabled Form Pills, and updated the documentation page to share how to use them in Figma along with more examples of the states.

## 👋 New Paste team members!

### Nick Sands

<ResponsiveImage src={Nick} />

Nick Sands (he/him/his) has joined the UX Infrastructure team as a Staff Product Designer!

Nick started his career as an elementary school teacher. His passion for helping people, solving hard problems, and building led him to a career in UX. He previously worked as a product designer building research and teaching tools for ITHAKA and a design prototyper at Delta Dental of California. He loves to work at the intersection of design and engineering, believing we can deliver the best user experience when they are tightly aligned.

Nick enjoys 3D printing, hockey, cats, and smoothies. He is a collector of hobbies. Nick and his wife Angela are expecting their first child (a boy!) in October.

## ✨ Pastemates™ spotlight

<em>
  Pastemates are individuals and teams who have been critical contributors to Paste, through advocating for adoption
  within their products and channeling important feedback and contributions back into the system.
</em>

<ResponsiveImage src={Andy} />

Our August Pastemate is none other than the original Paste prototyping pioneer, Andy Doyle. Andy is a Product Designer on the Billing team, based in Ireland. Upon joining Twilio, Andy jumped right into the Paste world and asked how he might go about [Designing in the Browser](https://csswizardry.com/2010/10/designing-in-the-browser-leads-to-better-quality-builds/). Andy’s comfort and experience with web-based technologies has led him to participate in the research and testing of [the Paste Prototyping Kit](https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste-prototype-kit) and is still one of the most active users. When asked about why he loves prototyping his design ideas he said:

<Box marginBottom="space70" fontSize="fontSize40" lineHeight="lineHeight40" color="colorTextWeak">
  <em>
    I love building prototypes that are as close to the real thing so I can see how my designs adapt at different screen
    sizes and how our customers interact with something that feels real. It’s never been easier to create web based
    prototypes with CSS Grid and Flexbox (and Paste{' '}
  </em>
  😉<em>)!</em>
</Box>

Andy has also been heavily involved in helping the UX Infrastructure team develop and conduct a [“Prototyping with Codesandbox”](https://www.figma.com/proto/zelCFduQmmQnoSavV6FtCc/Prototyping-with-CodeSandbox---UX-Showcase?node-id=2%3A6&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1) workshop series, aimed at teaching folks how to use Paste to prototype and validate product ideas with customers quickly, with realistic interactive prototypes. Better yet, the code is directly transferable to production environments, empowering our team of builders to get their ideas to market quickly.

Andy’s contributions have not only influenced greater (and easier) prototyping, but have also demonstrated how to establish stronger partnerships between engineers and product designers. Which in turn, have helped facilitate better hand-offs and product development discussions.

## 🔬 Paste by numbers

Did you know that we have data on Paste usage? We track:

- \# of repositories that import Paste packages

## Installation

## Usage

```jsx
import {Paragraph} from '@twilio-paste/core/paragraph';

const Component = () => (
  <Paragraph>
    We have inherited a fear of memories of slavery. It is as if to remember and acknowledge slavery would amount to our
    being consumed by it. As a matter of fact, in the popular black imagination, it is easier for us to construct
    ourselves as children of Africa, as the sons and daughters of kings and queens, and thereby ignore the Middle
    Passage and centuries of enforced servitude in the Americas. Although some of us might indeed be the descendants of
    African royalty, most of us are probably descendants of their subjects, the daughters and sons of African peasants
    or workers.
  </Paragraph>
);
```

## Props

<PropsTable componentApi={props.componentApi} />

## Code of Conduct

1. Keep it civil

2. Keep it focused on the time period we’re retro-ing.

3. Be candid

4. Write enough detail to clarify the facts and your feelings around the issue.

5. Keep the team accountable for action items that we’ve missed.

## Paste Retrospective Format

I feel like we don’t make use of our 1-hour retros very well and the end, where we actually talk about the problems and action items, are always condensed into the last 5-10 minutes. I would like to propose an agenda and guidelines to help shift this around.

### 5 minutes

**Activity** - Run through the last sprints action items and check in on progress.

**Purpose** - Give ourselves accountability

---

### 10 minutes

**activity** - Silently adding retro items you’d like to be discussed. Stuff that went well, Stuff that didn’t go well.

**purpose** - Get everyone's voices heard, things they’d like to celebrate, things they found challenging.

---

### 10 minutes

**activity** - Read through. One facilitator reads through each item

**purpose** - Makes sure each item has sufficient context to allow the entire team to a) decide whether they’d like to vote for it b) decide if that item is related to another and can be grouped / merged

**rules** - _Absolutely_ no discussion on details or solutions. This is just context-setting.

---

### 5 minutes

**activity** - Group / merge related items together into single items that can be voted on

**purpose** - Reduce the amount of scope for the voting

**rules** - The facilitator does the merging, the group agrees which ones are related so items don’t get miss merged

---

### 5 minutes

**activity** - VOTE! 3 votes, votes for the ones you’d like to see discussed the most

**purpose** - We don’t have time to discuss everything in the detail it requires to get action items. By voting, we can concentrate on the ones that matter the most for that sprint.

---

### 25 minutes

**activity** - Discuss the top 3 most voted items. 10 minutes (ish) each.

**purpose** - Understand the problems we faced with the particular item, get everyone's view and experiences with that item, the learning we can take from them and create realistic, achievable actions items that we hold ourselves accountable for following up on or resolving _before the next retro_.

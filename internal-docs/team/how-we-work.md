We work in a structured and deliberate manner. We do this by assigning ourselves work based on estimates of how much we can accomplish in a two week interval, called a [Sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_Sprint). These estimates are based on a running historical average of past Sprints. Over time, we become better at estimating our work and our estimates gain accuracy. This process can also provide a fair and realistic assessment of what we may accomplish in the future; we use this information to outline what we may achieve over the next few quarters of work in our [Roadmap](https://paste.twilio.design/roadmap/). In the following sections, we dive deeper into how exactly this all works.

## UX Rituals

We don't attend all of these all the time, except All Hands, but it can be helpful to know these exist. Check the [shared UX calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=twilio.com_e5umur5ba099ps98snodli8628%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) for exact times.

- Core UX All Hands every 2 Months (1hr).
- Product Design critiques every week. Schedule varies depending on the crit pod (1hr each).
- UX Showcase (demo) every month (1hr).

# Meeting details and insights

## Daily Standup (0.5hrs)

We allocate 30 minutes to gather daily and take turns sharing:

- What we worked on the day prior
- What we're working on today
- If we have any blockers to continuing or finishing our work

Each person usually shares their update in 1-2 minutes. If time permits, we'll use extra time at the end for “16th minute” discussions with the team that don't quite fit into the structure above, and additional backlog refinement. These are how to share new updates with the team or try to reach consensus quickly on a small decision.

## Backlog Alignment (0.5hrs)

This is a super quick meeting to help the Design and Engineering teams get aligned on their dependencies for release commitments. It ensures we're each backlog refining the right work, to support each other's shared goals for the release.

## Backlog Refinement (Design 1hr + Engineering 1hr)

This meeting entails digging through our backlogs and reviewing newly added tickets, sorting tickets by priority, and deleting tickets that are no longer relevant. This is a valuable exercise, as otherwise our backlog will grow to be a giant mess of forgotten bugs and projects.

We split backlog refinement into two parallel meetings as the team has grown over time.

## Sprint Retrospective (1hr)

At the end of each sprint, we spend some time reflecting on recent wins or kudos and observations around areas of improvement for our team. This is a good forum to make sure we're all on the same page and living up to our principles and working agreements. Continuous improvement requires moments of self-reflection.

## Sprint Planning (1hr)

We also spend the last 30mins of this meeting planning work for the next sprint. Sometimes this work is tweaked to address concerns brought up in the retrospective. Generally, we allocate a number of tickets that add up to our running point average for engineering and design.

## Release Planning (1hr)

We run a 6 week planning cycle, ensuring we can deliver small, incremental product updates at a reliable and predictable cadance. 6 weeks relates to 3 sprints worth of work. This is sufficiently long enough to tackle large roadmap items, and small enough to keep the team regularly delivering value to our customers.

It also allows us to stay extremely agile, re-prioritizing our roadmap at 6 week intervals to adopt to any change in company priorities.

## Office Hours

Twilions can attend our office hours on alteranting Tuesdays and Thursdays. Anyone can join to listen in, but only 3 people can reserve 20 minute slots to present problems and ask questions. These meetings are recorded and shared in [#help-design-system](https://app.slack.com/client/T024FJ1MS/CBEQHHDLP). The signup sheet can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10vD91zdwr9hjgDOV3HSGnoC0LgvYw-thmn3X_kvW0xk/edit#gid=800758837](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10vD91zdwr9hjgDOV3HSGnoC0LgvYw-thmn3X_kvW0xk/edit#gid=800758837). Remember that you represent Twilio and Paste at these meetings, and please be excellent to one another.

## Staff Fortnightly

The staff fortnightly meetings are a place where we can each catch up on what's happening outside the day-to-day operations, and share it with our team lead (Simon Taggart). It is a place to generally discuss longer term initiatives and make sure all teammates are in the loop. #NoInnerCircles

## Engineer & Designer Focus Times

Although we work together often and see each other in many meetings throughout the week, this meeting is specifically about having a chance to talk about the nitty gritty of code or design. It's a place to bounce ideas off each other and code or design pair. It's also a block of time reserved for heads down work in silence, if no one has anything to share.

## Design Systems Committee

The purpose of the Design Systems committee is to ensure we're collecting feedback from across Twilio teams in a consistent and actionable way. The committee includes Product Designers and Front-end Engineers from a cross-section of Twilio product subgroups, teams, and UX groups. New component, API, and pattern designs are shared with committee members for feedback and customer risk assessment.

# An overview of our project lifecycle

When starting a new project, like creating a new Paste component for example, we follow a set of overarching steps to make sure we're adequately considering and communicating to our customers.

The general process goes something like this:

1. Planning
2. Kickoff
3. Design
4. Review
5. Development
6. Internal review
7. Ship stage 1 or 2
8. Announcement

## Planning

The planning step is an informal, individual process where generally one to two team members do upfront research on the project at hand. A document of findings and research is the result of this step, and said document is used as the foundation for the kickoff.

## Kickoff

The kickoff meeting is a staff meeting where the project owner(s) presents their findings, unknowns, and projected outcomes to the rest of the team. This is where we carefully decide what is in scope and out of scope of the project, based on complexity and requirements. The kickoff is concluded when there's team agreement on next steps, the plan set forth, the “Definition of Done”, and a sense that we've covered all our bases. Remember, design for future change. Our solutions today may not be the solution tomorrow, so sometimes doing less, or designing solutions a certain way allow us to add changes in the future. Here's an [example kickoff brief document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lMGwbQPbGPcHUjo0IgGAQxWSmWX7yu5X4S50Ry4hKp4/edit#heading=h.f582p09662fi).

Template: [Component spec and kickoff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e1m4amg1Khbxo-limb-PPDSJvNeDF2YBFCWrqeS5MPc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Design

Designers take the brief and begin working on designing solution(s). The [design spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ciGnSQmkWLnkKr6h3KEEPvbehchX_sv-VmJ5QHZIs88/edit) is created along with any design files/mocks. The outcome is a Figma document with all states and permutations considered and designed for.

## Committee Review

Now that we've established a plan and have preliminary designs, we seek a public review from a committee of Twilions in related design or development departments in order to provide context we may have missed (i.e.: “This doesn't work in Flex because of X consideration”). This step involves a bit of back and forth, to make sure we round out to the correct solution. Any feedback is taken into consideration and the designer works on designs with all constraints in mind.

## Development

After the review is done, engineers can pick up the designs, spec and the kickoff document to begin the work of building the feature.

## Internal Review

The engineer that built the feature cannot merge or ship the feature until a final internal review is undergone. This entails a number of automated checks, code reviews, and design reviews.

## Ship stage 1 or 2

When the internal review passes, the engineer can now release the feature for public consumption. We call this stage 1 or 2 (depending on whether the component went through Committee Review), in order to communicate that the release is still new; when the feature sees real world use we might encounter edge cases we had not considered which may require additional fixes. We usually remain in stage 1 or 2 for a couple months, which gives enough time for teams to pick up the feature and ship work using it to production.

## Announcement

As soon as the feature is live, we announce it to our customers in Slack. This helps folks that were waiting for that feature to be aware that it is ready and also serves as a discoverability mechanism for what Paste is doing.

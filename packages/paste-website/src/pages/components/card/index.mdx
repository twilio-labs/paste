## Guidelines

### About Cards

Cards are specifically-styled containers that group related content and actions. Cards are a great tool for placing a concise amount of related information together in one object, much like a business card or baseball card in real life.

Card is an extremely flexible container that does not require specific components inside of it. You can compose a Card to support your use case, but elements such as [Heading](/components/heading), [Paragraph](/components/paragraph), and [Button](/components/button) or [Anchor](/components/anchor) are commonly used.

A Card does not handle any interactive events such as hover, click, or focus, though children composed inside of it may commonly have event handlers.

Acknowledging the flexibility of Card component, there are several [non-negotiable properties](#anatomy) of a Card that differentiate it from a more basic page-layout element, such as [Box](/primitives/box) including background color, border width, border radius, and border color.

### Card vs. Box

At its core, Card is a [Box](/primitives/box) with specific styling attributes and more explicit use cases that you can find in [Examples](#examples).
If you find yourself limited by the default styling and constraints of a Card, you may consider using a Box instead,
but first consider bringing the problem you are trying to solve
to Design System Office Hours to see if another component or pattern could fit your needs.

### Examples

#### Default Card

By default, a Card has `space100` padding, which can be adjusted with [padding props](/components/card/api#card) and [spacing tokens](/tokens/list#spacings).

<StoryPreview
  height="350px"
  title="Card examples - default"
  storyID="website-cardexamples--default-example"
  code={DefaultExample}
/>

#### Adjusting padding

You can set non-default padding on all sides of a Card.

<StoryPreview
  height="470px"
  title="Card examples - adjusting padding"
  storyID="website-cardexamples--adjusting-padding-example"
  code={AdjustingPaddingExample}
/>

#### Card with Title, Body and Button

One of the most common use cases for a Card is to relate a title ([Heading](/components/heading)), supporting body copy ([Paragraph](/components/paragraph)),
and primary action ([Button](/components/button)) together. Relating these three elements together with a Card makes it easy for a user to
digest and provides a clear call to action.

<StoryPreview
  title="Card examples - title body button"
  storyID="website-cardexamples--title-body-button-example"
  code={TitleBodyButtonExample}
/>

#### Marketing card

Use these layouts when you need to draw customers’ attention to upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Use them sparingly, mainly when they’ll help customers solve immediate problems.

<Callout variant="neutral" marginY="space70">
  <CalloutHeading as="h5">Research insight on marketing and cross-selling</CalloutHeading>
  <CalloutText>
    Research from Twilio has shown that cross-sell cards aren’t useful when the developers are in the product focused on urgent problems. They’re likely to ignore these cards, regardless of how they’re presented, until they’re relevant to a current project they’re working on.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

To create a marketing card, start by layering items from the top of this list. Add or remove items as you work your way down to create the right level of emphasis for your card:

1. Place the content at the top of the page.
2. Add more padding than other text content or Cards around it. Start with `space-130` and size up in 8px increments from there.
3. Add an illustration.
4. If you’re cross-selling across platforms (e.g., Segment, SendGrid, Communications, Flex), add a [brand Badge](/components/badge#brand).

Most marketing content in the product is a _suggestion_ to customers. As you layer items from the list, make sure you’re not distracting from their main goals on a page. A marketing Card should catch a customer’s attention but not at the expense of everything else in the flow.

Don’t use everything in the list at once. If your marketing content is not the main content of a page, use 1-2 items. If it is the main content, use no more than 3 items.

You might even find out that you don’t need to put your content in a Card. To emphasize the content without using Card, use [Box](/primitives/box) and `color-background-weak`.

Use more padding and illustrations:

<StoryPreview
  height="310px"
  title="Card examples - marketing one"
  storyID="website-cardexamples--marketing-one-example"
  code={MarketingOneExample}
/>
<StoryPreview
  height="330px"
  title="Card examples - marketing two"
  storyID="website-cardexamples--marketing-two-example"
  code={MarketingTwoExample}
/>

Use illustrations and a marketing Badge:

<StoryPreview
  height="540px"
  title="Card examples - marketing three"
  storyID="website-cardexamples--marketing-three-example"
  code={MarketingThreeExample}
/>

Don’t use Card at all:

<StoryPreview
  height="660px"
  title="Card examples - marketing four"
  storyID="website-cardexamples--marketing-four-example"
  code={MarketingFourExample}
/>

If these options don’t work for your use case and you need to create something custom, [request a creative review with the Brand team](https://library.twilio.com/guidelines/guide/9306890b-4bde-4210-bb35-2a566890e47a/page/db009ba3-57e3-4e04-bfe3-efc5d38860d1) and partner with them to make sure it aligns with Twilio’s brand guidelines.

#### Pricing cards

Use this layout to show a group of cards with pricing plans. Use a brandmarketing [Badge](/components/badge#brand) to highlight a “recommended” plan and decorative Badges for a customer’s current plan.

The text layout in each Card is a suggestion. Adjust it as needed for your use case.

<StoryPreview
  height="520px"
  title="Card examples - pricing"
  storyID="website-cardexamples--pricing-example"
  code={PricingExample}
/>

## Composition notes

When a Card contains text content, use the following guidelines:

- Use a [Heading](/components/heading) to highlight the most important information.
- Use a [Paragraph](/components/paragraph) to add additional context. Do not repeat the information in the header. Front-load the most critical information.
- When presenting multiple Cards of equal weight on a single page, structure each Card's content similarly.

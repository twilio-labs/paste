# New Icon Request
There is a new icon request on GitHub. As the helper, here's what you should do.
Read the request and review the needed icon(s).
Ensure the requested icon is suitable to be part of Paste library:
It doesn’t already exist
If it exists, you can suggest using the current one or ask to explain why a different one is needed
It is not too similar to an existing one or it doesn’t convey the concept in a optimal way
If it's too similar, you can propose other options using streamline (send your proposal to the discussion)
It is a general concept that can easily be used by other teams (i.e. a shopping cart)
If it's not clear to you, directly ask the requester if the icon will be used by other teams
If the icon is not suitable, ask the requester to add it to their local libraries (confirm with the broader team if necessary)
If the icon is suitable, ask the requester to file a dependency in Aritable.
Once the dependency is submitted, mark the GitHub ticket as 'Fix/change in progress'.
Keep in mind that icons are batched together in the last sprint of each release. Check release dates here
Create a Jira ticket with the next release date 'Figma: Icons for YYYY.MM.DD release' for designers to work on the task.
Include the list of icons names to be included in the release along with their links to the GitHub discussion.
Clone the Jira ticket and name it 'Add icons for 2024.05.14 release' for the engineering ticket.
Update Icon Requests
If you're a helper and there are open/unanswered icon request discussions:
Check if the requested icons have been released and are ready to use:
You can check the CHANGELOG in the repository: https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/blob/main/packages/paste-icons/CHANGELOG.md
You can check the last icon package deploy on NPMJS.com - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@twilio-paste/icons?activeTab=versions
Update the requester with the status only if the icons are released and ready to use, and provide the link to the PR and Figma.
Icon Request Design
If you’re assigned an icon design ticket:
Review the list of icons in the ticket and their discussions.
Follow the Paste Docs instructions to add a new icon to Figma.
When ready, send your branch for review to #plz-design-systems.
When approved, export each icon individually following Paste Docs instructions.
Attach the SVGs (individually) to the engineer's Jira ticket.

That’s all—hooray!

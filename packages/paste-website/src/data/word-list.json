  "above": "Avoid using directional language. It's confusing when read by a screenreader and is difficult for localization.",
  "active": "Avoid. Use 'on' or 'live' instead.",
  "activate": "Avoid. Use 'turn on' or 'enable' instead.",
  "add": "Use when the action is truly additive or the item is being added to a container (list, group, etc.). For generating something, use 'create'.",
  "admin": "Sounds friendlier, less formal than 'administrator'",
  "app": "Use instead of 'application' - simpler, more widely used.",
  "back": "Use for a process or workflow to refer moving backwards.",
  "below": "Avoid using directional language. It's confusing when read by a screenreader and is difficult for localization.",
  "bug": "Except for referencing the debugger, characterize as an 'issue'. Not all users may know what a bug is.",
  "button": "Just refer to the name of the button, don't refer to the fact that it's a button. For example, 'Select Start' instead of 'Select the Start button'",
  "cancel": "Use for stopping a process or workflow, where there's no expectation that the user would want to save their work.",
  "choose": "Avoid. Use 'select'.",
  "clear": "Use for removing filters, deselecting checkboxes, etc.",

  "clone": "Avoid. Use 'copy' or 'duplicate' depending on context.",
  "close": "Use for dismissing a modal or window, or in situations where the user would want to save their work.",
  "confirm": "Avoid if possible. Try something friendlier like 'make sure' or 'check'",
  "continue": "Avoid in workflows. Use 'next' instead.",

  "create": "Use to refer to generating something new. Don't use 'new'.",
  "deactivate": "Avoid. Use 'turn off' or 'disable' instead.",
  "debugger": "Do not capitalize. This is a generic term and not something specific to our product suite.",
  "delete": "Use when the action is permanent and the item is unretrievable.",
  "deselect": "Avoid. It's difficult to translate and can be confusing. Use 'clear' or 'clear all' instead.",
  "disable": "Use when referring to the action of making a feature unavailable or not operational. \n This is a more technical word, so consider content best practices (simple words!) and your audience. Use less technical words like 'off' or 'turn off' if it won't hinder comprehension or accuracy, or if you're writing for a less technical audience (like marketers).",
  "disabled": "Use for conveying a status where the entity or feature is preventing a broader feature to function. \n This is a more technical word that could be perceived as jargon, so consider content best practices (simple words!) and your audience. Use the less technical term 'off' if it won't hinder comprehension or accuracy, or if you're writing for a less technical audience (like marketers).",
  "dismiss": "Avoid. Use 'close' instead.",
  "done": "Avoid. Use 'finish' or 'close' instead, depending on the use case. Actions more closely describe what will happen when the user clicks the button.",
  "download": "Use as a call to action when a user need to copy data from Twilio to a computer system",
  "duplicate": "Use when allowing user to create a replica of an existing item.",
  "easy / easily": "Avoid. This contains a value judgement and can make users feel dumb if it doesn't feel easy to them.",
  "edit": "Use when referring to changing or updating a specific feature or item. For example, you can edit a tracking plan or edit a dashboard. If referring to more global controls, like permissions, access, or admin features, use 'manage'.",
  "e.g.": "Avoid. Some people don't understand what they mean, and they're hard to translate. Use 'For example' instead.",
  "enable": "Use when referring to the action of making a feature available or operational. \n This is a more technical word, so consider content best practices (simple words!) and your audience. Use less technical words like 'on' or 'turn on' if it won't hinder comprehension or accuracy, or if you're writing for a less technical audience (like marketers). \n For example, using 'enable' is appropriate in relation to a reverse ETL model. You can enable the model, but the reverse ETL process is not fully on. Multiple other reverse ETL features also need to be working for the entire process to happen. \n Avoid this word when describing benefits of a product. Instead describe what the user can accomplish. For example, instead of 'Journeys enables you to personalize experiences,' try 'Personalize the customer experience with...'. ",
  "enabled": "Use for conveying a status where an entity/feature is allowing the broader feature to function. \n This is a more technical word that could be perceived as jargon, so consider content best practices (simple words!) and your audience.

  "inactive": "Avoid. Use 'off' or 'disabled' instead.",
  "in order to": "Avoid. Just say 'to'.",
  "info": "Sounds friendlier and less formal than 'information.' Consider using 'information' in more serious situations, like privacy or legal contexts.",
  "invalid": "Avoid if possible. This is fairly technical term. Use 'wrong', 'not working', 'not right', or another less technical expression. Ideally, you can explain what's actually wrong with the code, input, etc.",

  "next": "Use for a process or workflow to refer moving forwards.",
  "off": "Use for when a feature or setting is not operating. \n This is the preferred term for a feature not functioning, because content best practices recommend simple, clear words.

  "OK": "Use instead of 'okay'.",
  "old, older": "To refer to an old version of software, feature, or item (like a Journey), use 'previous'.",
  "on": "Use for when a feature or setting is operating. \n This is the preferred term for a feature functioning, because content best practices recommend simple, clear words. \n Consider using 'enabled' if 'on' would call comprehension or accuracy into question, or if the feature allows a larger feature to function.",

  "our": "Using 'our' when referring to Twilio is okay for in-product content. Avoid in technical documentation.",

  "run": "Use to describe the action of executing a command or script. Avoid 'fire', 'trigger', and 'execute'.",
  "select": "Use when a user has to take an action in the interface. Select is device agnostic, and is also more inclusive for those using assistive technology.",

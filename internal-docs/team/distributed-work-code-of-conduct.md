tl;dr We’ve got someone in every time zone.

| Team member       | Timezone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Meetings

### Before a meeting

#### If you’re the organizer

1. Select a time that coincides with working hours for all attendees.
   1. Being inclusive means giving everyone the opportunity to stay involved and in the loop. Setting meetings at times that aren’t accommodating to people geographically goes against our [core principles](https://paste.twilio.design/introduction/about-paste#design-system-principles).
   2. As a scheduler, you should make every effort to work within set working hours as shown in Google Cal and avoid conflicts/blocked times.
   3. Make the meeting editable by **anyone**
2. Add a Zoom link to the calendar event.
3. If you want attendees to provide input or read materials before the meeting, send a reminder email _at least 24 hours before the meeting_. Add the reading materials to the calendar event, as well.
4. _Every_ meeting should have an agenda, including:
   1. The facilitator, **if you feel it’s necessary**.
      1. Good guideline: Name a facilitator if there are at least 4 attendees or substantial content. If a facilitator is not defined/present, everyone should feel empowered to nominate themselves, or ask someone explicitly to facilitate.
   2. Talking points. You should give enough information so that each attendee can decide how and when their input can be helpful.

### If you’re an attendee or facilitator

1. Read the agenda and any attached material. If there’s no agenda, feel _absolutely_ empowered to decline the meeting.
   1. Note: some internal meetings can be agenda-less on purpose (i.e., show and tells)
2. As an invitee you are encouraged to decline or suggest new times for meetings.
3. Add working hours to your calendar.
4. Suggestion action: Make your calendar public. In Google Calendar, go to “Settings for my calendars” > “Access permissions”. Change the setting for “Make available for Twilio Inc.” to “See all event details” 2. Note you can still make certain events on your calendar private.
5. Keep calendars up to date with time off, appointments, work breaks, etc.

## During a meeting

### If you’re the organizer or a presenter

1. State what you’re trying to achieve by the end of the meeting so attendees know how to contribute effectively.
2. Give everyone an opportunity to speak.
   1. Leave calculated pauses to give others room to interject and ask questions.
   2. If you’re aware that someone has thoughts about a certain subject, ask for their input directly.
3. Take notes during the meeting so that you can summarize results and those who weren’t able to attend have context of what happened. 3. You may also ask the facilitator to take notes.
4. Leave 5 minutes toward the end for additional questions. 4. Ending meetings early is better than going over time or worse, not giving people the time to ask questions or share input.
5. If you notice someone coming in late, make a point to catch them up on context.
6. If you are recording the meeting, ask permission of the audience.

### If you’re an attendee

1. Equipment rules:
   1. If there’s even one person remote, every attendee should individually join the Zoom meeting.
      1. “If one person is remote, everyone is remote.” Having several people in one room talking to each other face-to-face, while others peer in from a distant TV isn’t an ideal remote environment.
   2. Position the microphone centrally in meeting rooms so that everyone can be heard at the same volume levels.
   3. Try to reduce distractions from your environment so that meetings can proceed with a respectful level of focus.
   4. Make sure your camera and mic work correctly before meetings to avoid delaying meeting start times. Issues happen, but we should be diligent in respecting everyone’s time.
   5. Effectively communicate via verbal or non-verbal means to let others know you are following, confused, lost, in disagreement etc.
   6. Cameras are optional with the understanding that we are still responsible for clear communication in another manner (slack/chat/verbal communication/etc).
   7. Speak up early and often if there are issues in the remote setup and you either cannot see or hear someone. Send a Slack message if you’re having Zoom issues.
2. If you can’t find room to interject: 8. **Use the “raise hand” feature in Zoom (Option + Y). Click on “Participants” on the bottom of the window → “Raise hand” on the bottom of the panel.** 9. Write down your thoughts and questions. 2. This allows you to keep focus on what’s being said without fear of forgetting your ideas, and helps you not to repeat points others have made. 3. This also creates a practice of documenting mid-meeting, so there’s less work in sharing information after the meeting.
3. Be conscious not to interrupt others. 10. Elbowing your way through a conversation doesn’t help get your arguments across. It can have the opposite effect and change the setting of the discussion from “you and others vs the problem” to “you vs others”. 11. Frequent interruptions can also shut others down from articulating their ideas.
4. If you start speaking at the same time as someone else, circle back to the person who gave you the right of way. 12. It’s common for two or more people to begin speaking at the same time. Keep those people in mind so that you can circle back and provide a psychologically safe space.
5. While the facilitator is mainly responsible for re-railing conversations, every attendee is empowered to be a backup voice for the facilitator.

### If you’re the facilitator

1. State that you’re the facilitator at the start of the meeting, so people know whose responsibility it is to guide the conversation.
2. Clarify the meeting’s goal if the organizer/presenter didn’t get a chance to.
3. Guide the flow of conversation to:
   1. Make sure everyone has context.
   2. Avoid tangents.
   3. Call out topics that are more appropriate to be discussed after the meeting (_i.e._, parking lots).
4. Timebox discussions to avoid overflowing meeting times.
5. You may be responsible for taking notes if the meeting organizer or presenter asks you to.
6. Monitor Slack in case any attendee is having Zoom connection issues. Pause the meeting if necessary.

### All meeting attendees

1. Create openings for people to ask questions or provide input.
   1. If two people start speaking at the same time, circle back to the person who gave the right of way.
   2. Monitor those who have used “raise hand” in Zoom and interject on their behalf.

## After a meeting

### If you’re the organizer

1. Send a follow-up to attendees (and others who might be interested) with notes and results from the meeting. This also gives people another channel [for additional thoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier) and is more referenceable than Slack.

### If you’re the facilitator

1. Send any notes you took to the meeting organizer so they can summarize and send out a follow-up.

## Additional Guidelines

### Caucus Test

Our [caucus test results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iS1FuLiUBvlA-HhBTDkImB4ytR4tkp8FaBXyMyD_qmI/edit) showed that certain subject matters or certain people require additional time for thoughts and opinions to form. If you want to hold a productive meeting it’s imperative that the information can be reviewed ahead of time so that everyone can be prepared for a more meaningful discussion.

### Twilio Remoties Guidelines

Twilio has a lot of great documentation here about working with remoties and being a remotie:

[https://wiki.hq.twilio.com/display/SKITTLES/Remoties](https://wiki.hq.twilio.com/display/SKITTLES/Remoties)

### Twilio Remoties Perks

[https://wiki.hq.twilio.com/display/SKITTLES/Remoties#Remoties-HomeOfficeExpenses](https://wiki.hq.twilio.com/display/SKITTLES/Remoties#Remoties-HomeOfficeExpenses)

- Office desk up to $250
- Office chair up to $200

### Twilio Remoties Slack

#erg-remoties - there’s a lot of great talk in there about which home office gear to buy. A great place to ask for opinions on chairs, desks, and all sorts of things too.

TBD: non-meeting-related codes of conduct. Maybe:

- Something around ad hoc discussions being summarized in #dsys-longform, and the purpose of #dsys-longform?)
- Async stand-up notes (if you can’t attend)
- Which of the [UX communications & meetings guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLshYH-1mrQqF3rBEP5tfZFlA0xLkAV4ey5xuqWzCY0/edit?ts=5d19f54f#heading=h.4jeww0cfbb7d) feel most relevant to us?

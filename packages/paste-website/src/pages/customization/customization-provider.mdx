The `CustomizationProvider` provides a central place for customizations to be applied to an application that is using Paste.

Say you want to build a web application or website using Paste, but want to have your own look and feelâ€”the `CustomizationProvider` exists to do just that.

If you&rsquo;re a Flex customer, and want to build a Flex plugin that follows your brand guidelines, the `CustomizationProvider` can be used for that as well.

## About the Customization Provider

Similar to the Paste [ThemeProvider](/tokens/theme-package), the `CustomizationProvider` uses [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to provide a [theme object](/tokens/theme-package/#theme) to any descendant components in the tree.

The `CustomizationProvider` currently differs in two ways:

1. Firstly, you set a `baseTheme`. The base theme tells the provider which Paste theme you would like to base your custom theme on. You can choose from the 'Default' or 'Dark' Theme.
2. Secondly, you set a `theme`, but unlike with the `<Theme.Provider />` you pass it an object.

## Selecting a Base Theme

Selecting a base theme allows you to choose which Paste theme you would like to build on top of. By default we select the Default theme for you, but if you would like to create a custom application using a dark theme, you can choose the Dark Base Theme as your starting point.

```
import {CustomizationProvider} from '@twilio-paste/core/customization';

const MyApp = () => (
  <CustomizationProvider baseTheme="Dark">
    rest of app
  </CustomizationProvider>
)
```

## Providing a Theme Object

For the `theme` prop you can pass a complete [theme object](/tokens/theme-package#theme) or a partial theme object for smaller customizations. If a partial theme object is passed, the `CustomizationProvider` merges the custom theme object with the base Paste theme you chose. For example, if you want to customize certain background color tokens of the Dark theme you would only need to pass the following:

```
import {CustomizationProvider} from '@twilio-paste/core/customization';

const MyApp = () => (
  <CustomizationProvider baseTheme="Dark" theme={{
    "backgroundColors": {
      "colorBackgroundPrimary": "rgb(80, 123, 30)",
      "colorBackgroundPrimaryDarker": "rgb(56, 86, 21)",
      "colorBackgroundPrimaryLighter": "rgb(154,199,232)",
      "colorBackgroundPrimaryLightest": "rgb(197, 223, 242)",
    }
  }}>
    rest of app
  </CustomizationProvider>
)
```

This will output the Paste theme of your choice with the custom background color tokens above. So any component using `colorBackgroundPrimary`, `colorBackgroundPrimaryDarker`, etc will use the custom background color token values instead of the background color token values provided by the base theme.

The theme object should follow the following format, where each theme key can take any valid [design token](/tokens) for that grouping:

<ThemeObjectDisplay />

Custom themes can also be imported as a json object, along with the `CustomizationProvider`. Remember, the custom theme must follow the format of the Paste theme object.

After importing the custom theme needs to be passed to the `theme` prop on the `CustomizationProvider`. The `CustomizationProvider` should wrap the root of your application, or part of the application you would like to theme.

```jsx
import {CustomizationProvider} from '@twilio-paste/core/customization';
import CustomTheme from './themes/theme.json';

const MyApp = () => (
  <CustomizationProvider baseTheme="Default" theme={CustomTheme}>
    rest of app
  </CustomizationProvider>
);
```

## Providing Component Elements

You'll soon be able to set a collection of Component Elements that you want to customize. A Component Element is a DOM node within a component that you can target by name and provide custom CSS for. There maybe one or more exposed Component Elements for any given component within Paste. Component Elements can also be created for your own custom components for your customers to customize.

Coming soon.

```
import {CustomizationProvider} from '@twilio-paste/core/customization';

const MyApp = () => (
  <CustomizationProvider baseTheme="Dark" elements={{
    CARD: {
      backgroundColor: 'colorBackground',
      borderRadius: 'borderRadius30',
      borderWidth: 'borderWidth20'
    }
  }}>
    rest of app
  </CustomizationProvider>
)
```

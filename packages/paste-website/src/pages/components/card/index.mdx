## Guidelines

### About Cards

Cards are specifically-styled containers that group relatable content and actions. Card is an extremely
flexible container that does not require specific components inside of it. You can compose a Card to support your use case,
but elements such as [Heading](/components/heading), [Paragraph](/components/paragraph), and [Button](/components/button) or [Anchor](/components/anchor) are commonly used.
See [When to use a Card](#when-to-use-a-card) and [Examples](#examples) for common Card patterns and dos/donts.

A Card does not handle any interactive events such as hover, click, or focus, though children
composed inside of it may commonly have event handlers.

Acknowledging the flexibility of Card component, there are several [non-negotiable properties](#anatomy)
of a Card that differentiate it from a more basic page-layout element, such as [Box](/primitives/box) including background color, border width, border radius, and border color.

### Card vs. Box

At its core, Card is a [Box](/primitives/box) with specific styling attributes and more explicit use cases that you can find in [Examples](#examples).
If you find yourself limited by the default styling and constraints of a Card, you may consider using a Box instead,
but first consider bringing the problem you are trying to solve
to Design System Office Hours to see if another component or pattern could fit your needs.

### Examples

#### Basic Card

An example of a Card with default padding.

<LivePreview scope={{Card, Paragraph, Heading, Anchor}} language="jsx">
  {`<Card>
  <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">Parable of the Talents</Heading>
  <Paragraph>
    Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought. To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears. To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool. To be led by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen. To be led by a liar is to ask to be lied to. To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph marginBottom="space0">— <Anchor href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60932.Parable_of_the_Talents">Octavia Butler</Anchor></Paragraph>
</Card>`}
</LivePreview>

#### Card with Title, Body and Button

One of the most common use cases for a Card is to relate a title ([Heading](/components/heading)), supporting body copy ([Paragraph](/components/paragraph)),
and primary action ([Button](/components/button)) together. Relating these three elements together with a Card makes it easy for a user to
digest and provides a clear call to action. Padding surrounding the inner content of a Card can be
adjusted to suit the needs of your implementation.

<LivePreview scope={{Card, Paragraph, Heading, Button}} language="jsx">
  {`<Card padding="space120">
  <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">This is a card with a primary action</Heading>
  <Paragraph>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam dui tellus, tristique in tincidunt cursus, efficitur
    at felis. Phasellus imperdiet, lorem et commodo egestas, arcu.
  </Paragraph>
  <Button variant="submit"> I am a primary action button </Button>
</Card>`}
</LivePreview>

#### Card with Centered Content

Your implementation use case may call for a Card with centered content. You can accommodate this by
using the alignment props available on some components, or by creating a custom layout inside your
Card using Box or Flex.

<LivePreview scope={{Card, Paragraph, Heading, Button, Text}} language="jsx">
  {`<Card padding="space200">
  <Text as="div" textAlign="center">
    <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">
      Let's verify your integration
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
      magna aliqua.
    </Paragraph>
    <Button variant="submit"> Test my integration </Button>
  </Text>
</Card>;`}
</LivePreview>

## Composing a Card

### When to use a Card

Cards are a great tool for relating a concise amount of related information together in one object, much like a business card or baseball card in real life.

For example, you might use a single Card as a summary for a feature whose call to action encourages a user to dive deeper. Alternatively, multiple Cards on a single page with hierarchy of equal weights could be used to highlight multiple choices or paths a user can take.

Ultimately, Card is a very flexible component that can fit a variety of needs. If you feel that you have a unique use case or are limited by the Card implementation, please visit Design System Office Hours to see how we can help address your needs.

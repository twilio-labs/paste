## Access to Figma

As a Twilio Designer, you have access to Figma. Join the Twilio organization by requesting an
account through [ServiceNow](https://twilio.service-now.com/sp/). When you have access to Figma, you can learn more by reviewing our [Working with Figma guide](https://www.figma.com/file/WiJFrYa9YpIcFUmT06gTn0/Working-with-Figma).

## Using libraries

### How to turn on libraries

Paste libraries are turned on by default in Figma. If you want to control libraries per file, go to the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù tab on a file, where you can also drag components into your file. Click the book icon in the upper corner. From the modal, you can turn libraries on and off. [Learn more about managing libraries](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500008731201-Manage-libraries-in-design-files).

### Main libraries

The following are the main libraries we recommend you have enabled for each Figma file. Any time a library is updated, you‚Äôll get a notification in your project asking if you‚Äôd like to update.

#### Paste libraries

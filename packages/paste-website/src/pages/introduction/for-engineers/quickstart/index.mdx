The quickest way to get started with Paste is to bootstrap a new React app using one of our templates for popular React frameworks, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). Both approaches will create a new React app with Paste installed and ready for development.

## Create an App

You can use either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) to bootstrap your project, but in these examples we will use Yarn.

### Using create-next-app

Next.js is a framework for building React apps that use server-side rendering and [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) is an easy way to bootstrap a new Next app with minimal configuration.

Paste has a pre-made template for `create-next-app` that comes with `@twilio-paste/core` and `@twilio-paste/icons` as dependencies and uses TypeScript.

To create a new `create-next-app` app using the Paste template execute the following commands:

```shell
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/tree/main/packages/paste-nextjs-template my-paste-app
cd my-paste-app
yarn dev
```

This starts your project in development mode and it can be seen at `http://localhost:3000`.

When you create the project, Paste is used in 2 files:

- `pages/_app.tsx`: creates a `MyApp` component, which wraps all pages. This is where the Paste [`<Theme.Provider>`](/core/theme-package#theme-provider) is added which enables any child component to use tokens.
- `pages/index.tsx`: a sample page with Paste components.

#### Scripts

- `yarn dev`: runs project in development mode, with hot reloading
- `yarn build`: creates a production build of the project
- `yarn start`: runs the project in production mode, need to run `yarn build` first

To read more in depth about how `create-next-app` works, check out [their documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).

### Using create-react-app

[`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) initializes a new React project with minimal configuration.

Paste has a pre-made template for `create-react-app` that comes with `@twilio-paste/core` and `@twilio-paste/icons` as dependencies and uses TypeScript.

To create a new `create-react-app` app using the Paste template execute the following command:

```shell
yarn create react-app --template @twilio-paste my-paste-app
cd my-paste-app
yarn start
```

This starts your project in development mode and it can be seen at `http://localhost:3000`.

When you create the project, Paste is used in a few places:

- `src/App.tsx`: creates an `App` component, which wraps all pages. This is where the Paste [`<Theme.Provider>`](/core/theme-package#theme-provider) is added which enables any child component to use tokens.
- `src/components`: a directory with 2 sample components that use Paste components.
- `src/pages/`: a directory with 3 sample pages that use Paste components.

#### Scripts

- `yarn start`: runs project in development mode, with hot reloading
- `yarn build`: creates a production build of the project
- `yarn test`: runs tests in watcher mode

To read more in depth about how `create-react-app` works, check out [their documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

## Usage

### Paste Components

You can use the Paste components anywhere that is wrapped by the [Theme Provider](#setting-up-the-theme-provider).

```jsx
import {Box} from '@twilio-paste/core/box';

const Component = () => (
  <Box margin="space20" backgroundColor="colorBackground">
    Hello Paste!
  </Box>
);
```

### Using Icons

The Paste Icons package provides icon components. They can be used to enhance the appearance of a web interface and break
up the monotony of text. Icons have to be imported individually.

```jsx
import {PlusIcon} from '@twilio-paste/icons/esm/PlusIcon';

const Component = () => (
  <Button variant="secondary" size="small" onClick={() => {}}>
    <PlusIcon decorative={true} />
    Add to cart
  </Button>
);
```

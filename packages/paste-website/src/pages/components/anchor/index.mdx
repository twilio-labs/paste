### Anchor vs. Button

Anchors should be used in place of a button if you only need to create a hyperlink to some other page or content. Anchors should not be used for submitting a form, closing a modal, moving to the next step in a flow, or any other click action that a button should handle.

If you need a click handler, you can use our button component. See the button documentation here.

### Accessibility

The anchor is built with standard accessible practices in mind. Those include an href attribute, link context, and opening and closing tags.

The title attribute was not included because it’s not exposed to all browsers in an accessible way, meaning most screen readers and touch-only devices will likely never see that information.

***

## Examples

### Default anchor
The default anchor is a basic text hyperlink. Only text can be used to compose the anchor. There are no other anchor variants at this time.

### External anchor

If an external URL is used for the href, the target and rel will automatically be updated to:
`target=”_blank”`
`rel=”noreferrer noopener”`

Even though the target and rel are set by default for external anchors, they can be overridden using the target and rel props.

***

## When to use an anchor
Use an anchor when you need to hyperlink to another page, app, or website.

Do
[an anchor to link to another page]

Don’t
[an anchor in place of a button]

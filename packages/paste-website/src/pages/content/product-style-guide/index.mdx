## Content principles

#### Identify your user and speak directly to them

- Consider who you're writing for and their technical level. Use words the user is familiar with.
- Address the user as _you_, refer to Twilio as _we_.

#### Write for the reading level of a 10-13 year old

- Use simple, short sentences and common words.
- Explain technical terms and write acronyms in full the first time a user sees them.

  <CalloutTitle>Using readability tools</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    Sites offering{' '}
    <Anchor href="https://readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php">
      free readability tools like this one
    </Anchor>{' '}
    can be useful for assessing the "reading age" of long content (more than 150 words). However, they're not great at
    testing short UI content that might only contain two or three words. Use them with caution. Look for a simpler word
    whenever you can to improve the readability of your content.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

#### Be inclusive of people and devices

- Avoid _click, tap, touch_ instructions as not every device supports touch.
- Instead, use _select_ to instruct a user to interact.
- Avoid relying on directional or color-based cues &mdash; _to the right, the blue button_. These are problematic for responsive products or users who see colors differently.
- Instead, write _the main menu_ or _select "Apply changes"_. Name the component or area you’re referencing.

#### Write as if the user is in a rush

- Avoid repetition and padding.
- Phrases we use when writing formally or presenting &mdash; _please note, so, in fact, in other words_ &mdash; should be cut.
- Chunk content and use headings to help the user find what they need.

#### Be direct and straightforward

- Lead with the reason (why), by front-loading messages with words that address the user’s needs.
- Leave the user with a clear instruction of how to address that need.
- Avoid relying on Twilio or industry jargon, idioms, or cultural references to communicate what you mean.
- Use the words that are most familiar to the user.

#### It’s ok to bend grammatical rules to sound natural

- End sentences with prepositions &mdash; _of, with, for_ &mdash; if it sounds less awkward.
- And you can start sentences with _But_ or _And_.
- Use contractions with pronouns &mdash; _it’s, there’s, you’ll, we’ll, you’re_ &mdash; to sound conversational.

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle>Exception: avoid contractions in error messages</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    Avoid contractions in negative scenarios. When a user is stressed, their comprehension suffers. Often users will
    read <em>can’t</em> as <em>can</em>, missing the -’t at the end. Write out error messages or destructive action
    warnings in full.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

## Punctuation

#### Ampersands &

**Avoid using ampersands.** In exceptional circumstances, if space is unavoidably restricted or it's part of a product/brand name, use "&".

**Do** use "and" instead of an ampersand (&).

- _Voice and messaging_
- _Create and submit a Regulatory Bundle._
- _Messages sent from AT&T to Twilio numbers are not impacted._

**Don't** use "&" just to make content shorter. If space is an issue, address the content and design together.

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle>Why?</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    {' '}
    Using "and" rather than the ampersand symbol (&) supports localization and users with lower literacy or cognitive
    impairments. Some screen readers can’t interpret the code behind an ampersand, which obscures the meaning for the
    user.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

***

#### Apostrophes '

**Do** use an apostrophe to indicate possession or belonging.

- The APIs of Twilio > Twilio's APIs
  - _The phone number's prefix._
  - _Choose from one of SendGrid's responsive email designs._

**Do** use an apostrophe to indicate missing letters.

- You are > you're
  - _You're not logged in._

**Don't** use apostrophes to make a plural. We should never see _Upgrade to buy phone number's_, _Install plugin's_, or _SID's_.

***

#### Commas ,

**Do** use the serial or 'Oxford' comma in a list of 3 or more items.

- _You can customize the agent desktop, channels, interaction routing, and reporting._

***

#### Exclamation marks !

**Do** use a single exclamation mark to support a celebration. But never more than one at a time (!!)

- _Congratulations, you sent your first email!_

**Don't** use exclamation marks to draw attention to or emphasise an error message or alert.
Exclamation marks can increase anxiety or sound like shouting. Unless it's a clear moment of success, don't use them.

***

#### Hyphens and dashes - &ndash; &mdash;

**Do** use hyphens (-) to create compound words.

- Hyphens never have a space either side.
  - _Add-on feature_

**Do** use en-dashes (&ndash;) indicate a range of values (time, dates, numerical amounts.)

- En-dashes never have a space either side.
  - _0-50 agents_
  - Tip: If your system does not support en-dashes, use a hyphen to indicate range.

**Avoid** using em-dashes (&mdash;) to create an emphatic pause.

- Tip: It's ok to write a very short sentence to emphasise its meaning.
  We might use em-dashes with friends and colleagues in email and chat to signify an added thought, but the user needs clarity over what's important.
  Give the thought a sentence or restructure your syntax.

***

#### Parentheses ( )

**Do** use parentheses to provide an example or explanation.

- _Password must contain a special character (&, @, %, \$, ^)_

**Do** use parentheses to note an acronym the first time a user encounters it.

- _Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a mechanism for securing your SIP connections._
  - In this example, the user is familiar with the term "SIP" but not "TLS."

***

#### Periods .

**Do** end every full sentence with a period.

- _Enable Flex Dialpad in Console._
- _Sign up for a free account._

**Don't** use periods at the end of fragments or incomplete sentences.

**Don't** use periods at the end of an anchor link if it is the last line on an alert or notification.

***

#### Quotation marks " "

**Do** use quotation marks to pick out words from a component or a file name.

- _Select "Apply changes"_
- _We recommend using dedicated accounts for your development environments, like "Flex Production" and "Flex Development."_

**Do** put punctuation inside quotation marks, if necessary.

- _To create a new project, select "Create My Flex Project."_

**Don't** use quotation marks to refer to products or features.
Products and features are proper nouns and should be capitalized to differentiate them.

***

#### Semicolons ;

**Avoid** using semicolons. In formal writing, semicolons are useful. In product content, they can be messy and confusing.

- If you feel your sentence needs a semicolon, simplify it or create two sentences.

**Do** use punctuation and conjunctions (_and_, _but_, _so_) to separate thoughts.

- List complex items that already contain a comma using bullet points. For example, state capitals
  - _Montgomery, Alabama_
  - _Juneau, Alaska_
  - _Phoenix, Arizona_
  
***

## Grammar and formatting

#### Abbreviations

**Do** use common abbreviations if space is limited, such as in form headings.

- _Ref._ in place of _Reference_
- _No._ or _#_ in place of _number_
- _Info_ in place of _information_

**Do** use a period at the end of the abbreviation if the last letter is not the same as the full word's last letter.
- _Ref._ in place of reference
- _Info_ in place of information

_Avoid_ using abbreviations in body copy. It might reduce the character count but it can increase cognitive load and reduce comprehension.

***

#### Acronyms

**Do** write the phrase in full, followed by the acronym in parentheses the first time a user encounters it.

- _Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a mechanism for securing your SIP connections._
  - In this example, the user is familiar with the term "SIP" but not "TLS."

***

#### American English

**Do** use American English spellings throughout products.

- _Behavior, dialed, color, artifact, center, license_ (for both verb and noun), _-ize_ endings, _program_ (for all meanings)

***

#### Bold and italics

##### Bold

**Do** use bold type sparingly, to draw attention to the most important word, number, or short phrase in your copy.

- Bold type can help a user scan the page more effectively by making landmarks more prominent.

**Do** consider using bold type to refer to UI elements in instructional content. E.g.

- _Select the location from **Region/State**._
- _Select **Continue** to review your order._

**Don't** use bold multiple times in body copy or for a whole sentence/paragraph. It dilutes its effect.

- Only **bold the most important information the user needs to retain** and only use it if user testing indicates a need.
- Consider if putting an important sentence on a new line will do a better job of making it stand out than making it bold.

##### Italics

**Avoid** using italic type wherever possible in product content.

- If you need to draw attention to a word, use bold type.
- If you need to quote a phrase, use quotation marks "like this."
- While you may see italics used elsewhere at Twilio, in products let's keep it simple and avoid it.

***

#### Capitalization

**Do** capitalize proper nouns – products, people, places.

- Products include features, programs, or systems that Twilio has given a specific name to.
- If a brand or product name uses a mix of upper and lower case (TwiML, eBay) use the name's convention.
- People are named individuals or identifiable roles.

**Don't** capitalize general terms (_email, contact center, platform, phone number_)

- Tip: If it's something Twilio has created or owns, it takes a capital.

***

#### Dates

**Do** write dates so that they are easy to scan and sound human to read aloud.

- _Day, Month DD, YYYY_ (_Sunday, May 17, 2020_) &mdash; when referencing a specific day and the year is not clear from the context.
- _Month DD, YYYY_ (_May 17, 2020_) &mdash; when the day of the week is unimportant or does not help the user scan.
- _Month YYYY_ (_May 2020_) &mdash; when only the month is relevant. Useful in subheads to organize chronological lists.

**Avoid** repeating information. If a history or log organizes its contents using _Month YYYY_ sub-headings, the following line items should use _Day DD_.

- For the subhead _January 2020_, the dates that follow would read _Wednesday 15_, _Tuesday 28_ and so on.

**Do** indicate a date range by using _to_ between values.

- _January 24 to February 3, 2020
- _January 24 to 28_

**Do** abbreviate months to their first 3 letters if space is limited.

- _Jan, Feb, Mar_

- Tip: If it's absolutely necessary to cite a specific date numerically, use the [ISO 8601 date format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime#:~:text=Introduction-,The%20International%20Standard%20for%20the%20representation%20of%20dates%20and%20times,Representation%20of%20dates%20and%20times%22.) YYYY-MM-DD But note that this may not be useful to your user. Always consider which format is quickest to scan and easiest to read aloud.

***

#### I/You/We/Us

**Do** refer to the user as _you_ and to Twilio as _we_.

- Tip: If the user has agency or ownership, use ‘I’ or ‘my’.
  - _If you still can’t connect, contact our support team._
  - _To access billing information, select My Account._
  - _I understand._ (This usage is almost exclusively for legal consent.)

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle as="h4">Legal content</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    Legal content follows different rules to product &mdash; e.g., in Terms of Service, Twilio is usually referenced in
    the third person. Always check with the legal team if the content regards consent.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

**Do** say _we_ instead of _Twilio_

- It's us talking, so there's no need to refer to us in the third person.
- If "Twilio" is included in a product or feature name, that's ok as that's using it as a noun.

***

#### Lists (all)

**Do** start each list item with the same part of speech – usually a noun or verb – to make the list "parallel."

- Punctuate the end of each item with a period if it is a complete sentence.
- Be consistent within the list. If one item takes a full point, all items should.

**Don't** punctuate the end of an item in a vertical list with a comma or ellipsis "..."

#### Lists (bullet points)

**Do** use bulleted lists for items linked by a topic. Make the list topic clear in the sentence or heading that precedes it.

#### Lists (numbered)

**Do** use numbered lists for items to be done or understood in a sequence.

**Avoid** listing more than 7 items &mdash; it's a lot to take in. Break a big lists into smaller ones with explanatory headings.

#### Lists (sentence)

**Do** use a sentence list if you’re explaining a short process, noting up to four options, or highlighting up to four key points. You just read a sentence list.

- Sentence lists should be used for no more than four items. Over four? List with bullet points.
- Use the Oxford comma before the last item in a sentence list.

***

#### Numbers

**Do** use precise numbers to express statistics, metrics, or quantities. Avoid rounding up or down when the user is depending on the information to be accurate.

**Do** use numerals (1, 2, 3, 45, 101) instead of spelling out the number.

- Percentages _49%_

**Do** write expressions that use ordinal numbers in words.

- _One to watch, thousands of options_
- _First, create a profile_

**Do** use both words and numerals to represent numbers over 1000, unless the user needs a specific number.

- _Up to 40k emails_
- _More than $1.5B_
- **Note** this is most commonly used in marketing content — make sure you're giving the user what they need to complete a task, and not overloading them with extra info.

**Do** use a space between the number and its unit of measurement or its order of magnitude if this is written out in words.

- _40 GB, 564 customers_
- _More than $1.3 billion, 45 million customers_

**Do** use commas in numbers that are four or more digits.

- _1,365 messages sent_

**Don't** use commas in error codes, account numbers, or phone numbers.

***

#### Sentence case

**Do** use sentence case everywhere, even in H1s, CTAs, and navigation. Sentence case makes content feel more human and it's generally easier to scan.

- This is sentence case. (Use this.)
- This is Title Case. (Rarely use this, and only if directed.)
- THIS IS ALL CAPS. (Don’t use this.)

***

#### Time

**Do** write times so that they are easy to scan and sound human to read aloud. Usually, this means using the 12hr clock, with am/pm modifiers.

- _12:25am_
- _3:32pm_

***

## Common errors

#### e.g./i.e.

- _e.g._ = for example
  - _Create a memorable name for your Flex Project, e.g. "Flex Training 2020."_
- _i.e._ = that is
  - Tip: _i.e._ usually precedes a simpler way of saying something. Say it simply the first time. Avoid writing _i.e._ if you can.

***

#### Every day/everyday

- _Every day_ = each day
  - _Twilio supports thousands of customers every day._
- _Everyday_ = ordinary/usual
  - _Twilio supports everyday customer needs, like call routing._

***

#### It's/its

- _It's_ = contraction of "it"+"is"
  - _It's now possible to view real-time queue stats._
  - Tip: Can you say _it is_ instead of the word you want? Does the sentence make sense? You want _it's_.
- _Its_ = possessive pronoun (belonging to it)
  - _The company and its customers._

***

#### Log in/login

- _Log in_ = verb

  - _Enter your login details._

***

#### Set up/setup

- _Set up_ = verb
  - _Set up your profile._

  - _System setup information can be found in the user guide._

***

#### Sign up/sign-up

- _Sign up_ = verb
  - _Sign up for a free account._
- Sign-up = noun/adjective
  - _Visit the sign-up page for more information._

***

#### Their/there/they're

- _Their_ = plural possessive pronoun (belonging to them)
  - _The main priority for agents is reducing their wrap-up time._
- _There_ = adverb meaning existing in/at that place
  - _There is a new version available._
- _They're_ = contraction of "they"+"are"
  - _Users are important. They're our top priority._

***

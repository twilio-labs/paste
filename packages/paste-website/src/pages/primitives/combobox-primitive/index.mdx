## Guidelines

### About the Combobox Primitive

This package provides a foundation upon which developers can implement a [WAI-Aria compliant Combobox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/combobox/aria1.1pattern/listbox-combo.html).
It can be used to build functional and accessible Comboboxes with or without autocomplete/typeahead features.
Our Combobox is built on top of this primitive.

The purpose of providing these unstyled primitives is to cater for instances when the styled Combobox provided
by Paste, doesn't meet the requirements needed to solve a unique or individual customer problem. At that point
you are welcome to fallback to this functional primitive to roll your own styled Combobox whilst still providing
a functional and accessible experience to your customers.

This primitive should be used to compose all custom Comboboxes to ensure accessibility and upgrade paths.

<Callout variant="warning">
  <CalloutTitle>Warning</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    We strongly suggest that all components built on top of this primitive get reviewed by the Design Systems team and
    goes through the UX Review process to ensure an excellent experience for our customers.

## Examples

### Basic Combobox

A basic Combobox is a direct replacement for the native HTML select element. It should function in roughly
the same way, the difference being in the ability to style everything about it; the input trigger, option list
and option content.

Contrary to the Downshift documentation and example, the basic Combobox should have an HTML input element as
the trigger, and not an HTML button. Use an input element and set the role of Combobox in the `getToggleButtonProps`
getter or directly on the element itself. You can see this demonstrated below:

<Callout>
  <CalloutText>
    Using an input element prevents screen readers like JAWS switching out of focus or forms mode when navigating
    through a form. This provides a really frustrating experience to users of JAWS. It is also a direct replacement for
    a form element, so the value should be accessible via the form submit event, which a button element will not
    provide.

### Autocomplete Combobox Example

This hook can be used to create custom autocomplete Combobox controls. These controls are useful when the
customer needs to filter a list of available options, or provide a custom free form value to the input.

## Usage Guide

This package is a wrapper around the [`Downshift` package](https://downshift.netlify.com).
Our wrapper currently only exposes the useCombobox hook, but renamed for Paste. The reason we chose
to just expose the hook is that we feel it is the most flexible way of consuming downshift and better
fit our chosen styling model.

If you’re wondering why we wrapped that package into our own, we reasoned that it would be
best for our consumers' developer experience. For example:

- If we want to migrate the underlying nuts and bolts in the future, Twilio products
  that depend on this primitive would need to replace all occurrences of `import … from ‘x-package’`
  to `import … from ‘@some-new/package’`. By wrapping it in `@twilio-paste/x-primitive`, this
  refactor can be avoided. The only change would be a version bump in the package.json file for the primitive.
- We can more strictly enforce semver and backwards compatibility than some of our dependencies.
- We can control when to provide an update and which versions we allow, to help reduce potential
  bugs our consumers may face.
- We can control which APIs we expose. For example, we may chose to enable or disable usage of
  certain undocumented APIs.

### Installation

```
yarn add @twilio-paste/combobox-primitive - or - yarn add @twilio-paste/core
```

### API

#### useComboboxPrimitive basic props

This is the list of props that you should probably know about. There are some
[advanced props](#usecomboboxprimitive-advanced-props) below as well.

##### items `any[]` | _required_

The main difference from vanilla `Downshift` is that we pass the items we want
to render to the hook as well. Opening the menu with an item already selected
means the hook has to know in advance what items you plan to render and what is
the position of that item in the list. Consequently, there won't be any need for
two state changes: one for opening the menu and one for setting the highlighted
index, like in `Downshift`.

##### itemToString `function(item: any)` | defaults to: `item => (item ? String(item) : '')`

If your items are stored as, say, objects instead of strings, downshift still
needs a string representation for each one. This is required for accessibility
messages (e.g., after making a selection).

**Note:** This callback _must_ include a null check: it is invoked with `null`
whenever the user abandons input via `<Esc>`.

##### onSelectedItemChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the selected item was changed. Selection can be performed by
item click, Enter Key while item is highlighted or by blurring the menu while an
item is highlighted (Tab, Shift-Tab or clicking away).

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `selectedItem` property
  with the newly selected value. This also has a `type` property which you can
  learn more about in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usecomboboxprimitive-state-actiontypes) section. This
  property will be part of the actions that can trigger a `selectedItem` change,
  for example `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.ItemClick`.

##### stateReducer `function(state: object, actionAndChanges: object)` | optional

**This is a really handy power feature**

This function will be called each time `useCombobox` sets its internal state (or
calls your `onStateChange` handler for control props). It allows you to modify
the state change that will take place which can give you fine grain control over
how the component interacts with user updates. It gives you the current state
and the state that will be set, and you return the state that you want to set.

- `state`: The full current state of downshift.
- `actionAndChanges`: Object that contains the action `type`, props needed to
  return a new state based on that type and the changes suggested by the
  Downshift default reducer. About the `type` property you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usecomboboxprimitive-state-actiontypes) section.

#### useCombobox advanced props

##### initialSelectedItem `any` | defaults to `null`

Pass an item that should be selected when downshift is initialized.

##### initialIsOpen `boolean` | defaults to `false`

Pass a boolean that sets the open state of the menu when downshift is
initialized.

##### initialHighlightedIndex `number` | defaults to `-1`

Pass a number that sets the index of the highlighted item when downshift is
initialized.

##### initialInputValue `string` | defaults to `''`

Pass a string that sets the content of the input when downshift is initialized.

##### defaultSelectedItem `any` | defaults to `null`

Pass an item that should be selected when downshift is reset.

##### defaultIsOpen `boolean` | defaults to `false`

Pass a boolean that sets the open state of the menu when downshift is reset or
when an item is selected.

##### defaultHighlightedIndex `number` | defaults to `-1`

Pass a number that sets the index of the highlighted item when downshift is
reset or when an item is selected.

##### defaultInputValue `string` | defaults to `''`

Pass a string that sets the content of the input when downshift is reset or when
an item is selected.

##### getA11yStatusMessage `function({/* see below */})` | default messages provided in English

This function is passed as props to a status updating function nested within
that allows you to create your own ARIA statuses. It is called when one of the
following props change: `items`, `highlightedIndex`, `inputValue` or `isOpen`.

A default `getA11yStatusMessage` function is provided that will check
`resultCount` and return "No results are available." or if there are results ,
"`resultCount` results are available, use up and down arrow keys to navigate.
Press Enter key to select."

##### getA11ySelectionMessage `function({/* see below */})` | default messages provided in English

This function is similar to the `getA11yStatusMessage` but it is generating a
message when an item is selected. It is passed as props to a status updating
function nested within that allows you to create your own ARIA statuses. It is
called when `selectedItem` changes.

A default `getA11ySelectionMessage` function is provided. When an item is
selected, the message is a selection related one, narrating
"`itemToString(selectedItem)` has been selected".

The object you are passed to generate your status message, for both
`getA11yStatusMessage` and `getA11ySelectionMessage`, has the following
properties:

| property              | type            | description                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `highlightedIndex`    | `number`        | The currently highlighted index                                                              |
| `highlightedItem`     | `any`           | The value of the highlighted item                                                            |
| `isOpen`              | `boolean`       | The `isOpen` state                                                                           |
| `inputValue`          | `string`        | The value in the text input.                                                                 |
| `itemToString`        | `function(any)` | The `itemToString` function (see props) for getting the string value from one of the options |
| `previousResultCount` | `number`        | The total items showing in the dropdown the last time the status was updated                 |
| `resultCount`         | `number`        | The total items showing in the dropdown                                                      |
| `selectedItem`        | `any`           | The value of the currently selected item                                                     |

##### onHighlightedIndexChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the highlighted item was changed. Items can be highlighted
while hovering the mouse over them or by keyboard keys such as Up Arrow, Down
Arrow, Home and End. Arrow keys can be combined with Shift to move by a step of
5 positions instead of 1. Items can also be highlighted by hitting character
keys that are part of their starting string equivalent.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `highlightedIndex`
  property with the new value. This also has a `type` property which you can
  learn more about in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usecomboboxprimitive-state-action-types) section. This
  property will be part of the actions that can trigger a `highlightedIndex`
  change, for example `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.MenuKeyDownArrowUp`.

##### onIsOpenChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the menu is open or closed. Menu can be open by toggle button
click, Enter, Space, Up Arrow or Down Arrow keys. Can be closed by selecting an
item, blur (Tab, Shift-Tab or clicking outside), clicking the toggle button
again or hitting Escape key.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `isOpen` property with
  the new value. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usecomboboxprimitive-state-action-types) section. This property will be
  part of the actions that can trigger a `isOpen` change, for example
  `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.ToggleButtonClick`.

##### onInputValueChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the value in the input text changes. The input value should
change like any input of type text, at any character key press, `Space`,
`Backspace`, `Escape` etc.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `inputValue` property
  with the new value. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more
  about in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usecomboboxprimitive-state-action-types) section. This property
  will be part of the actions that can trigger a `inputValue` change, for
  example `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputChange`.

##### onStateChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

This function is called anytime the internal state changes. This can be useful
if you're using downshift as a "controlled" component, where you manage some or
all of the state (e.g., isOpen, selectedItem, highlightedIndex, etc) and then
pass it as props, rather than letting downshift control all its state itself.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usecomboboxprimitive-state-action-types) section.

##### highlightedIndex `number`

The index of the item that should be highlighted when menu is open.

##### isOpen `boolean`

The open state of the menu.

##### selectedItem `any`

The item that should be selected.

##### inputValue `string`

The value to be displayed in the text input.

##### id `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used to generate the first part of the `Downshift` id on the elements. You can
override this `id` with one of your own, provided as a prop, or you can override
the `id` for each element altogether using the props below.

##### labelId `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`label`) you use
[`getLabelProps`](#getlabelprops) with.

##### menuId `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`ul`) you use
[`getMenuProps`](#getmenuprops) with.

##### toggleButtonId `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`button`) you use
[`getToggleButtonProps`](#gettogglebuttonprops) with.

##### inputId `string` | defaults to a generated ID

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`input`) you use
[`getInputProps`](#getmenuprops) with.

##### getItemId `function(index)` | defaults to a function that generates an ID based on the index

Used for `aria` attributes and the `id` prop of the element (`li`) you use
[`getItemProps`](#getitemprops) with.

##### environment `window` | defaults to `window`

This prop is only useful if you're rendering downshift within a different
`window` context from where your JavaScript is running; for example, an iframe
or a shadow-root. If the given context is lacking `document` and/or
`add|removeEventListener` on its prototype (as is the case for a shadow-root)
then you will need to pass in a custom object that is able to provide
[access to these properties](https://gist.github.com/Rendez/1dd55882e9b850dd3990feefc9d6e177)
for downshift.

##### circularNavigation `boolean` | defaults to `true`

Controls the circular keyboard navigation between items. If set to `true`, when
first item is highlighted, the Arrow Up will move highlight to the last item,
and viceversa using Arrow Down.

#### useComboboxPrimitive state change types

There are a few props that expose changes to state
(`onStateChange` and `stateReducer`). For you
to make the most of these APIs, it's important for you to understand why state
is being changed. To accomplish this, there's a `type` property on the `changes`
object you get. This `type` corresponds to a `stateChangeTypes` property.

The list of all possible values this `type` property can take is defined in
[this file][state-change-file] and is as follows:

- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputKeyDownArrowDown`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputKeyDownArrowUp`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputKeyDownEscape`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputKeyDownHome`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputKeyDownEnd`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputKeyDownEnter`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputChange`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.InputBlur`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.MenuMouseLeave`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.ItemMouseMove`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.ItemClick`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.ToggleButtonClick`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.FunctionToggleMenu`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.FunctionOpenMenu`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.FunctionCloseMenu`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.FunctionSetHighlightedIndex`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.FunctionSelectItem`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.FunctionSetInputValue`
- `useCombobox.stateChangeTypes.FunctionReset`

#### useComboboxPrimitive control props

Downshift manages its own state internally and calls your
`onSelectedItemChange`, `onIsOpenChange`, `onHighlightedIndexChange`,
`onInputChange` and `onStateChange` handlers with any relevant changes. The
state that downshift manages includes: `isOpen`, `selectedItem`, `inputValue`
and `highlightedIndex`. Returned action function (read more below) can be used
to manipulate this state and can likely support many of your use cases.

However, if more control is needed, you can pass any of these pieces of state as
a prop (as indicated above) and that state becomes controlled. As soon as
`this.props[statePropKey] !== undefined`, internally, `downshift` will determine
its state based on your prop's value rather than its own internal state. You
will be required to keep the state up to date (this is where `onStateChange`
comes in really handy), but you can also control the state from anywhere, be
that state from other components, `redux`, `react-router`, or anywhere else.

> Note: This is very similar to how normal controlled components work elsewhere
> in react (like `<input />`). If you want to learn more about this concept, you
> can learn about that from this the
> [Advanced React Component Patterns course](#advanced-react-component-patterns-course)

#### useComboboxPrimitive returned

##### useComboboxPrimitive prop getters

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle>On prop getters and accessibility</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    These prop-getters provide `aria-` attributes which are very important > to your component being accessible. It's
    recommended that you utilize these > functions and apply the props they give you to your components.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

###### getLabelProps

This method should be applied to the `label` you render. It will generate an
`id` that will be used to label the toggle button and the menu.

There are no required properties for this method.

> Note: For accessibility purposes, calling this method is highly recommended.

###### getMenuProps

This method should be applied to the element which contains your list of items.
Typically, this will be a `<div>` or a `<ul>` that surrounds a `map` expression.
This handles the proper ARIA roles and attributes.

Optional properties:

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getMenuProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})` and
  your composite component would forward like: `<ul ref={props.innerRef} />`.
  However, if you are just rendering a primitive component like `<div>`, there
  is no need to specify this property. It defaults to `ref`.

  Please keep in mind that menus, for accessiblity purposes, should always be
  rendered, regardless of whether you hide it or not. Otherwise, `getMenuProps`
  may throw error if you unmount and remount the menu.

- `aria-label`: By default the menu will add an `aria-labelledby` that refers to
  the `<label>` rendered with `getLabelProps`. However, if you provide
  `aria-label` to give a more specific label that describes the options
  available, then `aria-labelledby` will not be provided and screen readers can
  use your `aria-label` instead.

In some cases, you might want to completely bypass the `refKey` check. Then you
can provide the object `{suppressRefError : true}` as the second argument to
`getMenuProps`. **Please use it with extreme care and only if you are absolutely
sure that the ref is correctly forwarded otherwise `useCombobox` will
unexpectedly fail.**

> Note that for accessibility reasons it's best if you always render this
> element whether or not downshift is in an `isOpen` state.

###### getItemProps

The props returned from calling this function should be applied to any menu
items you render.

**This is an impure function**, so it should only be called when you will
actually be applying the props to an item.

Required properties:

The main difference from vanilla `Downshift` is that we require the items as
props before rendering. The reason is to open the menu with items already
highlighted, and we need to know the items before the actual render. It is still
required to pass either `item` or `index` to `getItemProps`.

- `item`: this is the item data that will be selected when the user selects a
  particular item.
- `index`: This is how `downshift` keeps track of your item when updating the
  `highlightedIndex` as the user keys around. By default, `downshift` will
  assume the `index` is the order in which you're calling `getItemProps`. This
  is often good enough, but if you find odd behavior, try setting this
  explicitly. It's probably best to be explicit about `index` when using a
  windowing library like `react-virtualized`.

Optional properties:

- `ref`: if you need to access the item element via a ref object, you'd call the
  function like this: `getItemProps({ref: yourItemRef})`. As a result, the item
  element will receive a composed `ref` property, which guarantees that both
  your code and `useCombobox` use the same correct reference to the element.

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getItemProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})` and
  your composite component would forward like: `<li ref={props.innerRef} />`.
  However, if you are just rendering a primitive component like `<div>`, there
  is no need to specify this property. It defaults to `ref`.

- `disabled`: If this is set to `true`, then all of the downshift item event
  handlers will be omitted. Items will not be highlighted when hovered, and
  items will not be selected when clicked.

###### getToggleButtonProps

Call this and apply the returned props to a `button`. It allows you to toggle
the `Menu` component.

Optional properties:

- `ref`: if you need to access the button element via a ref object, you'd call
  the function like this: `getToggleButton({ref: yourButtonRef})`. As a result,
  the button element will receive a composed `ref` property, which guarantees
  that both your code and `useCombobox` use the same correct reference to the
  element.

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getToggleButton({refKey: 'innerRef'})`
  and your composite component would forward like:
  `<button ref={props.innerRef} />`. However, if you are just rendering a
  primitive component like `<div>`, there is no need to specify this property.
  It defaults to `ref`.

- `disabled`: If this is set to `true`, then all of the downshift button event
  handlers will be omitted (it won't toggle the menu when clicked).

###### getInputProps

This method should be applied to the `input` you render. It is recommended that
you pass all props as an object to this method which will compose together any
of the event handlers you need to apply to the `input` while preserving the ones
that `downshift` needs to apply to make the `input` behave.

There are no required properties for this method.

Optional properties:

- `disabled`: If this is set to true, then no event handlers will be returned
  from `getInputProps` and a `disabled` prop will be returned (effectively
  disabling the input).

- `ref`: if you need to access the input element via a ref object, you'd call
  the function like this: `getInputProps({ref: yourInputRef})`. As a result, the
  input element will receive a composed `ref` property, which guarantees that
  both your code and `useCombobox` use the same correct reference to the
  element.

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getInputProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})` and
  your composite component would forward like: `<input ref={props.innerRef} />`.
  However, if you are just rendering a primitive component like `<div>`, there
  is no need to specify this property. It defaults to `ref`.

In some cases, you might want to completely bypass the `refKey` check. Then you
can provide the object `{suppressRefError : true}` as the second argument to
`getInput`. **Please use it with extreme care and only if you are absolutely
sure that the ref is correctly forwarded otherwise `useCombobox` will
unexpectedly fail.**

This method should be applied to the `input` wrapper element. It has similar
return values to the `getRootProps` from vanilla `Downshift`, but renaming it as
it's not a root element anymore. We are encouraging the correct `combobox` HTML
structure as having the combobox wrapper as a root for the rest of the elements
broke navigation and readings with assistive technologies. The wrapper should
contain the `input` and the `toggleButton` and it should be on the same level
with the `menu`.

There are no required properties for this method.

In some cases, you might want to completely bypass the `refKey` check. Then you
can provide the object `{suppressRefError : true}` as the second argument to
`getComboboxProps`. **Please use it with extreme care and only if you are
absolutely sure that the ref is correctly forwarded otherwise `useCombobox` will
unexpectedly fail.**

##### useComboboxPrimitive actions

These are functions you can call to change the state of the downshift
`useCombobox` hook.

| property              | type                      | description                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `closeMenu`           | `function()`              | closes the menu                                       |
| `openMenu`            | `function()`              | opens the menu                                        |
| `selectItem`          | `function(item: any)`     | selects the given item                                |
| `setHighlightedIndex` | `function(index: number)` | call to set a new highlighted index                   |
| `setInputValue`       | `function(value: string)` | call to set a new value in the input                  |
| `toggleMenu`          | `function()`              | toggle the menu open state                            |
| `reset`               | `function()`              | this resets downshift's state to a reasonable default |

##### useComboboxPrimitive state

These are values that represent the current state of the downshift component.

| property           | type      | description                       |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `highlightedIndex` | `number`  | the currently highlighted item    |
| `isOpen`           | `boolean` | the menu open state               |
| `selectedItem`     | `any`     | the currently selected item input |
| `inputValue`       | `string`  | the value in the input            |

---

#### useMultiSelectPrimitive basic props

This is the list of props that you should probably know about. There are some
[advanced props](#usemultiselectprimitive-basic-props) below as well.

##### itemToString `function(item: any)` | defaults to: `i => (i == null ? '' : String(i))`

If your items are stored as, say, objects instead of strings, downshift still
needs a string representation for each one. This is required for accessibility
aria-live messages (e.g., after removing a selection).

##### onSelectedItemsChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the selected items array changes. Especially useful when items
are removed, as there are many ways to do that: `Backspace` from dropdown,
`Backspace` or `Delete` while focus is the item, executing `removeSelectedItem`
when clicking an associated `X` icon for the item.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `selectedItems`
  property with the new array value. This also has a `type` property which you
  can learn more about in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usemultiselectprimitive-state-action-types) section.
  This property will be part of the actions that can trigger an `selectedItems`
  change, for example `useSelect.stateChangeTypes.DropdownKeyDownBackspace`.

##### stateReducer `function(state: object, actionAndChanges: object)` | optional

**This is a really handy power feature**

This function will be called each time `useMultipleSelection` sets its internal
state (or calls your `onStateChange` handler for control props). It allows you
to modify the state change that will take place which can give you fine grain
control over how the component interacts with user updates. It gives you the
current state and the state that will be set, and you return the state that you
want to set.

- `state`: The full current state of downshift.
- `actionAndChanges`: Object that contains the action `type`, props needed to
  return a new state based on that type and the changes suggested by the
  Downshift default reducer. About the `type` property you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usemultiselectprimitive-state-action-types) section.

#### useMultiSelectPrimitive advanced props

##### keyNavigationNext `string` | defaults to `ArrowRight`

The navigation key that increments `activeIndex` and moves focus to the selected
item whose index corresponds to the new value. For a `RTL` scenario, a common
overriden value could be `ArrowLeft`. In some scenarios it can be `ArrowDown`.
It mostly depends on the UI the user is presented with.

##### keyNavigationPrevious `string` | defaults to `ArrowLeft`

The navigation key that decrements `activeIndex` and moves focus to the selected
item whose index corresponds to the new value. Also moves focus from `dropdown`
to item with the last index. For a `RTL` scenario, a common overriden value
could be `ArrowRight`. In some scenarios it can be `ArrowUp`. It mostly depends
on the UI the user is presented with.

##### initialSelectedItems `any[]` | defaults to `[]`

Pass an initial array of items that are considered to be selected.

##### initialActiveIndex `number` | defaults to `-1`

Pass a number that sets the index of the focused / active selected item when
downshift is initialized.

##### defaultSelectedItems `any[]` | defaults to `[]`

Pass an array of items that are going to be used when downshift is reset.

##### defaultActiveIndex `number` | defaults to `-1`

Pass a number that sets the index of the focused / active selected item when
downshift is reset.

##### getA11yRemovalMessage `function({})` | default messages provided in English

This function is similar to the `getA11yStatusMessage` or
`getA11ySelectionMessage` from `useSelect` and `useCombobox` but it is
generating an ARIA a11y message when an item is removed. It is passed as props
to a status updating function nested within that allows you to create your own
ARIA statuses. It is called when an item is removed and the size of
`selectedItems` decreases.

A default `getA11yRemovalMessage` function is provided. When an item is removed,
the message is a removal related one, narrating "`itemToString(removedItem)` has
been removed".

The object you are passed to generate your status message for
`getA11yRemovalMessage` has the following properties:

| property              | type            | description                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resultCount`         | `number`        | The count of selected items in the list.                                                     |
| `itemToString`        | `function(any)` | The `itemToString` function (see props) for getting the string value from one of the options |
| `removedSelectedItem` | `any`           | The value of the currently removed item                                                      |
| `activeSelectedItem`  | `any`           | The value of the currently active item                                                       |
| `activeIndex`         | `number`        | The index of the currently active item.                                                      |

##### onActiveIndexChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

Called each time the index of the active item changes. When an item becomes
active, it receives focus, so it can receive keyboard events. To change
`activeIndex` you can either click on the item or use navigation keys between
the items and the dropdown.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This object is guaranteed to contain the `activeIndex` property
  with the new value. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more
  about in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usemultiselectprimitive-state-action-types) section.

##### onStateChange `function(changes: object)` | optional, no useful default

This function is called anytime the internal state changes. This can be useful
if you're using downshift as a "controlled" component, where you manage some or
all of the state (e.g. selectedItems and activeIndex) and then pass it as props,
rather than letting downshift control all its state itself.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#usemultiselectprimitive-state-action-types) section.

> Tip: This function will be called any time _any_ state is changed. The best
> way to determine whether any particular state was changed, you can use
> `changes.hasOwnProperty('propName')` or use the `on[statePropKey]Change` props
> described above.

> NOTE: This is only called when state actually changes. You should not attempt
> to use this to handle events. If you wish handle events, put your event
> handlers directly on the elements (make sure to use the prop getters though!
>
> For example: `<button onBlur={handleBlur} />` should be
> `<button {...getDropdownProps({onBlur: handleBlur})} />`).

##### activeIndex `number` | **control prop**

(read more about this in [the Control Props section](#control-props))

The index of the item that should be active and focused.

##### selectedItems `any[]` | **control prop**

(read more about this in [the Control Props section](#usecomboboxprimitive-control-props))

The items that are considered selected at the time.

##### environment `window` | defaults to `window`

This prop is only useful if you're rendering downshift within a different
`window` context from where your JavaScript is running; for example, an iframe
or a shadow-root. If the given context is lacking `document` and/or
`add|removeEventListener` on its prototype (as is the case for a shadow-root)
then you will need to pass in a custom object that is able to provide
[access to these properties](https://gist.github.com/Rendez/1dd55882e9b850dd3990feefc9d6e177)
for downshift.

#### useMultiSelectPrimitive state change types

There are a few props that expose changes to state
(`onStateChange` and `stateReducer`). For you
to make the most of these APIs, it's important for you to understand why state
is being changed. To accomplish this, there's a `type` property on the `changes`
object you get. This `type` corresponds to a `stateChangeTypes` property.

The list of all possible values this `type` property can take is defined in
[this file][state-change-file] and is as follows:

- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.SelectedItemClick`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.SelectedItemKeyDownDelete`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.SelectedItemKeyDownBackspace`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.SelectedItemKeyDownNavigationNext`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.SelectedItemKeyDownNavigationPrevious`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.DropdownKeyDownNavigationPrevious`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.DropdownKeyDownBackspace`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.DropdownClick`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.FunctionAddSelectedItem`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.FunctionRemoveSelectedItem`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.FunctionSetSelectedItems`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.FunctionSetActiveIndex`
- `useMultipleSelection.stateChangeTypes.FunctionReset`

#### useMultiSelectPrimitive control Props

Downshift manages its own state internally and calls your
`onSelectedItemsChange`, `onActiveIndexChange` and `onStateChange` handlers with
any relevant changes. The state that downshift manages includes: `selectedItems`
and `activeIndex`. Returned action function (read more below) can be used to
manipulate this state and can likely support many of your use cases.

However, if more control is needed, you can pass any of these pieces of state as
a prop (as indicated above) and that state becomes controlled. As soon as
`this.props[statePropKey] !== undefined`, internally, `downshift` will determine
its state based on your prop's value rather than its own internal state. You
will be required to keep the state up to date (this is where `onStateChange`
comes in really handy), but you can also control the state from anywhere, be
that state from other components, `redux`, `react-router`, or anywhere else.

> Note: This is very similar to how normal controlled components work elsewhere
> in react (like `<input />`).

#### useMultipleSelection returned props

The properties of `useMultipleSelection` can be split into three categories as indicated below.

##### useMultiSelectPrimitive prop getters

<Callout>
  <CalloutTitle>On prop getters and accessibility</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    These prop-getters provide `aria-` attributes which are very important > to your component being accessible. It's
    recommended that you utilize these > functions and apply the props they give you to your components.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

These functions are used to apply props to the elements that you render. This
gives you maximum flexibility to render what, when, and wherever you like. You
call these on the element in question, for example on the toggle button:

```jsx
<button {...getDropdownProps()}
```

It's advisable to pass all your props to that
function rather than applying them on the element yourself to avoid your props
being overridden (or overriding the props returned).

For example:
`getDropdownProps({preventKeyAction: isOpen})`.

See this [blog post about prop getters](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-give-rendering-control-to-users-with-prop-getters 'How to give rendering control to users with prop getters')

| property               | type           | description                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `getDropdownProps`     | `function({})` | returns the props you should apply to either your input or toggle button, depending on the case. |
| `getSelectedItemProps` | `function({})` | returns the props you should apply to any selected item elements you render.                     |

##### getSelectedItemProps

The props returned from calling this function should be applied to any selected
items you render. It allows changing the activeIndex by using arrow keys or by
clicking, but also removing items by `Delete` or `Backspace` on active item. It
also ensures that focus moves along with the activeIndex, and it keeps a
`tabindex="0"` on the active element even if user decides to `Tab` away. That
way, when tabbing back, the user can pick up where he left off with selection.

**This is an impure function**, so it should only be called when you will
actually be applying the props to an item.

Required properties:

It is required to pass either `selectedItem` or `index` to
`getSelectedItemProps` in order to be able to apply the activeIndex logic.

- `selectedItem`: this is the item data that will be selected when the user
  selects a particular item.
- `index`: This is how `downshift` keeps track of your item when updating the
  `activeIndex` as the user keys around. By default, `downshift` will assume the
  `index` is the order in which you're calling `getSelectedItemProps`. This is
  often good enough, but if you find odd behavior, try setting this explicitly.
  It's probably best to be explicit about `index` when using a windowing library
  like `react-virtualized`.

Optional properties:

- `ref`: if you need to access the dropdown element via a ref object, you'd call
  the function like this: `getDropdown({ref: yourDropdownRef})`. As a result,
  the dropdown element will receive a composed `ref` property, which guarantees
  that both your code and `useMultipleSelection` use the same correct reference
  to the element.

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call:
  `getSelectedItemProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})` and your composite component
  would forward like: `<li ref={props.innerRef} />`. However, if you are just
  rendering a primitive component like `<div>`, there is no need to specify this
  property. It defaults to `ref`.

##### getDropdownProps

Call this and apply the returned props to a `button` if you are building a
`select` or to an `input` if you're building a `combobox`. It allows you to move
focus from this element to the last item selected by using `ArrowLeft` and also
to remove the last item using `Backspace`.

Optional properties:

- `preventKeyAction`: tells `useMultipleSelection` if `dropdown` is allowed to
  execute `downshift` handlers on `keydown`. For example, you can pass `isOpen`
  as value and user will not be able to delete selecteditems by `Backspace` or
  to navigate to them by arrow keys. This is useful if you don't want to mix key
  actions from multiple selection with the ones from the dropdown. Once the
  dropdown is closed then deletion / navigation can be resumed for multiple
  selection. The value is `false` by default.
- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getDropdownProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})`
  and your composite component would forward like:
  `<button ref={props.innerRef} />`. However, if you are just rendering a
  primitive component like `<div>`, there is no need to specify this property.
  It defaults to `ref`.

In some cases, you might want to completely bypass the `refKey` check. Then you
can provide the object `{suppressRefError: true}` as the second argument to
`getDropdownProps`.

**Please use it with extreme care and only if you are
absolutely sure that the ref is correctly forwarded otherwise
`useMultipleSelection` will unexpectedly fail.**

```javascript
const {getDropdownProps} = useMultipleSelection()
const {isOpen, ...rest} = useComboboxPrimitve({items})
const myButton = (
  {/* selected items */}
  <button {...getDropdownProps({preventKeyAction: isOpen})}>Click me</button>
  {/* menu and items */}
)
```

##### Actions

These are functions you can call to change the state of the downshift
`useMultipleSelection` hook.

| property             | type                      | description                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `addSelectedItem`    | `function(item: any)`     | adds an item to the selected array                    |
| `removeSelectedItem` | `function(item: any)`     | removes an item from the selected array               |
| `reset`              | `function()`              | resets the selectedItems and active index to defaults |
| `setActiveIndex`     | `function(index: number)` | sets activeIndex to the new value                     |
| `setSelectedItems`   | `function(items: any[])`  | sets selectedItems to the new value                   |

##### State

These are values that represent the current state of the downshift component.

| property        | type     | description                           |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `activeIndex`   | `number` | the index of thecurrently active item |
| `selectedItems` | `any[]`  | the items of the selection            |

#### Event Handlers

Downshift has a few events for which it provides implicit handlers. Several of
these handlers call `event.preventDefault()`. Their additional functionality is
described below.

##### Default handlers

###### Dropdown - button or input

- `ArrowLeft`: Moves focus from `button`/`input` to the last selected item and
  makes `activeIndex` to be `selectedItems.length - 1`. Performs this action if
  there are any items selected. `ArrowLeft` can be overriden with any other key
  depeding on the requirements.
- `Backspace`: Removes the last selected item from selection. It always performs
  this action on a non-input element. If the `dropdown` is a `combobox` the text
  cursor of the `input` must be at the start of the `input` and not highlight
  any text in order for the removal to work.

###### Item

- `Click`: It will make the item active, will modify `activeIndex` to reflect
  the new change, and will add focus to that item.
- `Delete`: It will remove the item from selection. `activeIndex` will stay the
  same if the item removed was not the last one, but focus will move to the item
  which now has that index. If the last item was removed, the `activeIndex` will
  decrease by one and will also move focus to the corresponding item. If there
  are no items available anymore, the focus moves to the dropdown and
  `activeIndex` becomes `-1`.
- `Backspace`: Same effect as `Delete`.
- `ArrowLeft`: Moves `activeIndex` and focus to previous item. It stops at the
  first item in the selection. `ArrowLeft` can be overriden with any other key
  depeding on the requirements.
- `ArrowRight`: Moves `activeIndex` and focus to next item. It will move focus
  to the `dropdown` if it occurs on the last selected item. `ArrowRight` can be
  overriden with any other key depeding on the requirements.

##### Customizing Handlers

You can provide your own event handlers to `useMultipleSelection` which will be
called before the default handlers:

```javascript
const items = [...] // items here.
const {getDropdownProps} = useMultipleSelection()
const {getInputProps} = useCombobox({items})
const ui = (
  /* label, selected items, ... */
  <input
    {...getInputProps(
      getDropdownProps({
        onKeyDown: event => {
          // your custom keyDown handler here.
        },
      }),
    )}
  />
)
```

If you would like to prevent the default handler behavior in some cases, you can
set the event's `preventDownshiftDefault` property to `true`:

```javascript
const items = [...] // items here.
const {getDropdownProps} = useMultipleSelection()
const {getInputProps} = useCombobox({items})
const ui = (
  /* label, selected items, ... */
  <input
    {...getInputProps(
      getDropdownProps({
        onKeyDown: event => {
          // your custom keyDown handler here.
          if (event.key === 'Enter') {
            // Prevent Downshift's default 'Enter' behavior.
            event.nativeEvent.preventDownshiftDefault = true

            // your handler code
          }
        },
      }),
    )}
  />
)
```

If you would like to completely override Downshift's behavior for a handler, in
favor of your own, you can bypass prop getters:

```javascript
const items = [...] // items here.
const {getDropdownProps} = useMultipleSelection()
const {getInputProps} = useCombobox({items})
const ui = (
  /* label, selected items, ... */
  <input
    {...getInputProps(
      getDropdownProps({
        onKeyDown: event => {
          // your custom keyDown handler here.
        },
      }),
    )}
    onKeyDown={event => {
      // your custom keyDown handler here.
    }}
  />
)
```

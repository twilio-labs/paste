## Contribution at a glance

Anyone at Twilio can propose and incubate a new pattern or update an existing pattern, though BU product designers are particularly well-equipped to do so given their proximity to the customer problem that a given pattern is meant to solve.

Design Systems will partner with contributors to ensure the systemizability and accessibility of a pattern, as well as on the documentation and creation of design assets (Sketch / Figma templates, etc).

<Callout variant="info">
  <CalloutTitle>We are piloting this contribution model!</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutText>
    This is a new contribution model, and we are looking for designers to pilot it, so please reach out if you are interested in contributing a new pattern to Paste.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

## Creating a new pattern

### Kicking it off

1. When you have decided to contribute a pattern, reach out in `#help-design-system` and let us know! We’ll work together to plan out the work, and we may be able to point you to any existing work on the pattern.
2. Reach out to your peers to collect any existing examples of the interaction or flow you are hoping to patternize.
3. Draft a design spec ([here’s a template for ya](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SSIURVMzlGbANyvtYlU61ZdDaSqF2QigFdFZuSnYSkk/edit?usp=sharing)) to outline usage guidelines for the new pattern. This spec will eventually become the documentation for this pattern on the Paste docs site.
4. Create a shareable design asset or code sandbox for the new pattern for the purpose of collecting feedback.
5. Work with the Design Systems team to do an audit of the spec and design to ensure it is systemizable and accessible.
6. After the audit, the pattern will be added to the Paste docs site and will be marked as a “[alpha](/patterns#available-patterns)”.

### Testing and collecting feedback
1. The alpha pattern will be shared with the Design Systems committee for review.
   - The committee members will do a Risk Assessment Survey to determine the level of user research the pattern requires.
   - Committee members will share the pattern in their crits to collect a broad set of feedback.
2. Iterate on the pattern design and spec based on internal and user feedback, and continue reviews with the Design Systems team and Design Systems committee until the pattern gets a 3+ from the full committee (on the fist to five scale).

### Finalizing a pattern
1. Finalize the designs and the design spec.
2. Partner with the Design Systems team to create any necessary assets and to finalize the docs page for the pattern.
3. The pattern will now move from the "[alpha](/patterns#available-patterns)" stage to the "[beta](/patterns#available-patterns)" stage and can be used by other Twilio teams. Patterns deemed low-risk by the committee may move directly from “[alpha](/patterns#available-patterns)” to “[production](/patterns#available-patterns)”.

## Updating an existing pattern

When you want to make an update to an existing pattern (be it a beta pattern, or a production pattern), you will follow many of the same steps as you would when contributing a new pattern, depending on the degree of the change. Reach out to us in #help-design-system if you’d like to update an existing pattern, and we can get the conversation started.

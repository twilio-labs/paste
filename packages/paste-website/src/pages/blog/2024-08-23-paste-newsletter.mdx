## üì£ What was new in Paste?

### Filter pattern

<Box marginBottom="space60">
  <Box
    borderColor="colorBorderWeaker"
    borderStyle="solid"
    borderWidth="borderWidth10"
    borderRadius="borderRadius20"
    overflow="hidden"
  >
    <Box
      as={Image}
      maxWidth="100%"
      height="100%"
      src={FiltersPattern}
      alt="Gif of Filters Pattern"
      style={{ objectFit: "contain" }}
    />
  </Box>
</Box>

We've updated our [filter pattern](/patterns/filter)! The simplified layout uses Form Pills, Popovers, and Side Panel to reduce visual noise and help customers focus on the data and information that matter most.

### Corner Ornament component

<Box width="100%" maxWidth="400px" display="block" margin="0 auto">
  <ResponsiveBorderedImage src={CornerOrnament} alt="Preview of Corner Ornament component" />
</Box>

The [Corner Ornament](/components/corner-ornament) component lets you quickly relate 2 graphic elements to each other. Use it to show unread notifications, cart counts, relationships in Tables, and more. The component supports a variety of Avatar and Icon sizes with built-in cutouts.

### Paste Figma library featuring typography and effect variables

<Box marginBottom="space60">
  <Box
    borderColor="colorBorderWeaker"
    borderStyle="solid"
    borderWidth="borderWidth10"
    borderRadius="borderRadius20"
    overflow="hidden"
  >
    <Box
      as={Image}
      maxWidth="100%"
      height="100%"
      src={FigmaTypography}
      alt="Gif of Figma Typography"
      style={{ objectFit: "contain" }}
    />
  </Box>
</Box>

We added typography and effect variables to the [Paste Components & Themes](https://www.figma.com/file/l2qtpQVMmXzQPVB3rEAA8i/Paste-Components-%26-Themes?type=design&node-id=3015-46646&mode=design&t=LavBWI8WtuCpWbz0-0) Figma library for more accurate swapping between Twilio, Twilio Dark, Evergreen, Default, and Dark themes.

[Learn more about how to swap modes](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15343816063383-Modes-for-variables#h_01H3ADKDF7JBTRV1Z5P1X1DZVE).

### Additional updates

#### New

- Added new [icons](/components/icon) for RCSCapable and SupportRequest

#### Updates

- [Badge](/components/badge#counter) has a new notification_counter variant.

And thank you for all these contributions, Joe Fehrman!:

- [Form Pill Groups](/components/form-pill-group#large) now have a large variant to support the Filter pattern
- [User Dialog](/components/user-dialog) has a smaller default size based on feedback from our consumers

## ‚ú® Pastemates‚Ñ¢ spotlight

Pastemates are individuals and teams who have been critical contributors to Paste, through advocating for adoption within their products and channeling important feedback and contributions back into the system.

In this edition of Pastemates, we're spotlighting a mate from the Platform Engineering team, **Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez Cort√©s**! Andr√©s built One Admin pages with minimal guidance outside of the written guidelines on the Paste doc site.

He recently attended Comms Platform UX office hours for a gut check on his implementation. Principal Designer **Andy Doyle** was thoroughly impressed with what he was able to achieve, saying it's an ‚Äúexceptional standard using latest Paste and all the guidance.‚Äù

Here's what Andr√©s has to say about working with Paste:

‚ÄúSince I arrived at Twilio 3 years ago, the Paste project got my attention. As a former visual designer turned web developer, I always have had a great interest in design systems and component libraries.

Paste made my development work much more enjoyable as I was feeling that I was building with Lego pieces. I didn't need to care about defining a color palette, border sizes, or managing the internal state of the components. I also took the time to read through the pattern guides and realized they were just goldmines of knowledge about good practices in UI and UX. I still enjoy reading them when I have time.

Most of the rough edges I've found are around integration with the form library we use (react-hook-form). But my experience with the Paste library has been great so far, and I really enjoy building interfaces with it given that the components are ready to use and the end result just looks very polished and professional.‚Äù

Bravo to Andr√©s and his attention to detail!

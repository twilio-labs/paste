## Guidelines

### About Form Pill Group

<Paragraph>
  {props.pageContext.frontmatter.description} They are used almost exclusively in multi-select editing situations.
</Paragraph>

A Form Pill Group can be used on its own to represent selection across a number of fields, such as displaying currently applied filters when filtering data across a number of different fields. Alternatively, a Form Pill Group can be paired directly to a single input field, such as a Combobox, to represent multiple selection.

#### Accessibility

The Form Pill Group provides a number of accessibility features. The only requirement is providing the Pill Group a descriptive label via the `aria-label` React prop.

##### Keyboard navigation

The Form Pill Group is focusable, but only one pill is focusable at a time. This means the Pill Group is a single tab stop to a keyboard user. Once a user is focused within the Pill Group, the following keyboard interactions apply:

- Left and right arrow keys move focus within the group
- If a pill is selectable, spacebar and enter will toggle pill selection
- If a pill has a supplied action via `onClick`, enter key will trigger that action
- If a pill is dismissible, the pill can be removed by pressing the delete or backspace key

#### Display Pill vs. Form Pill

There are some very important semantic differences between a Display Pill and Form Pill Group. Below is a table explaining the main differences to get a better understanding of when to use each type of pill.

<FormPillVsDisplayPillTable />

## Examples

### Basic Form Pill Group

The basic Form Pill Group can be composed by adding `FormPill` components as children of `FormPillGroup`. These must be used with the `useFormPillState` hook, and the returned state should be spread onto each component.

This will provide you with some internal state management and keyboard navigation.

<LivePreview scope={{FormPill, FormPillGroup, useFormPillState, CalendarIcon}} noInline>
  {defaultExample}
</LivePreview>

### Selectable Form Pill Group

To make pills inside the Pill Group selectable, manage the selection state yourself and combine it with the state returned from the `useFormPillState` hook.

To do so, track which pill is selected in a separate store of state. When rendering the Pill Group, cross reference the rendered pills with the selection state, and conditoinally set `selected` on each `FormPill` that requires it.

The `onSelect` event handler will fire when ever the pill is clicked, or the spacebar or enter key is pressed. Use this to respond to your users' selection interactions.

  {selectableExample}
</LivePreview>

### Removable Form Pill Group

Form Pills are given a closing "x" button when provided an `onDismiss` event handler. Because the Form Pill Group is largely presentational, you can provide "removable" functionality by managing the state of the rendered pills. By responding to user interactions and hooking into the `onDismiss` event handler, the rendered state of the Form Pill Group can be updated and pills can be selectively removed from the collection.

The `onDismiss` event handler will fire when a user clicks on the close x, or presses their backspace or delete key when foused on a pill.

### Simple Multiselect Combobox Example

Using Form Pill Group, along with the [Combobox Primitive](/primitives/combobox-primitive#multiselect-combobox-example) you can easily compose an interactive multiple select form field.

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    useComboboxPrimitive,
    useMultiSelectPrimitive,
    Box,
    Label,
    Input,
    useUID,
    useUIDSeed,
    ComboboxListbox,
    ComboboxListboxGroup,
    ComboboxListboxOption,
    FormPill,
    FormPillGroup,
    useFormPillState,
  }}
  noInline
  language="jsx"

  {multiSelectExample}
</LivePreview>

## Composition Notes

### When to use a Form Pill Group

Use Form Pill Groups when you are editing a collection of data within a form. It can be used to represent selection across multiple fields such as filtering, or from a single field like a combobox.

<DoDont>
  <Do title="Do" body="Use Form Pills in editable forms to represent a collection of similar entities." />
  <Dont title="Don't" body="Don't use Form Pills outside of a form or editing scenarios." />
</DoDont>

<DoDont>
  <Do title="Do" body="Only pass FormPill as a direct descendent of a FormPillGroup." />
  <Dont
    title="Don't"
    body="Don't pass FormPillGroup any other component type, and do not wrap FormPill in any other component of DOM element."
  />
</DoDont>

## Usage Guide

### API

#### Installation

```bash
yarn add @twilio-paste/form-pill-group - or - yarn add @twilio-paste/core
```

#### Usage

```jsx
import {useFormPillState, FormPillGroup, FormPill} from '@twilio-paste/core/form-pill-group';

export const Basic = () => {
  const pillState = useFormPillState();

  return (
    <form>
      <FormPillGroup {...pillState} data-testid="form-pill-group" aria-label="Your favorite sports:">
        <FormPill data-testid="form-pill" {...pillState}>

        </FormPill>
      </FormPillGroup>
    </form>
  );
};
```

#### Props

##### FormPillGroup

**Note:** Most required props are provided by spreading the returned state from `useFormPillState`.

###### `aria-label: string`

Defines a string value that labels the current element.

###### `move: (id: string | null) => void`

Moves focus to a given item ID.

###### `first: () => void`

Moves focus to the first item.

###### `last: () => void`

Moves focus to the first item.

###### `items: Item[]`

Lists all the pill items with their id, DOM ref, disabled state and groupId if any. This state is automatically updated when registerItem and unregisterItem are called.

###### `setCurrentId: Dispatch<SetStateAction<string | null | undefined>>`

Lists all the pill items with their id, DOM ref, disabled state and groupId if any. This state is automatically updated when registerItem and unregisterItem are called.

###### `element?: string`

Set a custom element name. Default: `FORM_PILL_GROUP`

###### `focusable?: boolean`

When an element is disabled, it may still be focusable. It works similarly to readOnly on form elements. In this case, only aria-disabled will be set.

###### `disabled?: boolean`

Same as the HTML attribute.

###### `baseId?: string`

ID that will serve as a base for all the items IDs.

###### `currentId?: string`

The current focused item id.

- undefined will automatically focus the first enabled composite item.
- null will focus the base composite element and users will be able to navigate out of it using arrow keys.
- If currentId is initially set to null, the base composite element itself will have focus and users will be able to navigate to it using arrow keys.

###### `groups?: Group[]`

Lists all the composite groups with their id and DOM ref. This state is automatically updated when registerGroup and unregisterGroup are called.

---

##### FormPill

**Note:** Most required props are provided by spreading the returned state from `useFormPillState`.

###### `baseId: string`

ID that will serve as a base for all the items IDs.

###### `setBaseId: string`

Sets baseId

###### `rtl: boolean`

Determines how next and previous functions will behave. If rtl is set to true, they will be inverted. This only affects the composite widget behavior. You still need to set dir="rtl" on HTML/CSS.

###### `items: Item[]`

Lists all the composite items with their id, DOM ref, disabled state and groupId if any. This state is automatically updated when registerItem and unregisterItem are called.

###### `groups: Group[]`

Lists all the composite groups with their id and DOM ref. This state is automatically updated when registerGroup and unregisterGroup are called.

###### `loop: boolean`

On one-dimensional composites:

- true loops from the last item to the first item and vice-versa.
- horizontal loops only if orientation is horizontal or not set.
- vertical loops only if orientation is vertical or not set.
- If currentId is initially set to null, the composite element will be focused in between the last and first items.

###### `wrap: boolean`

Has effect only on two-dimensional composites. If enabled, moving to the next item from the last one in a row or column will focus the first item in the next row or column and vice-versa.

- true wraps between rows and columns.
- horizontal wraps only between rows.
- vertical wraps only between columns.
- If loop matches the value of wrap, it'll wrap between the last item in the last row or column and the first item in the first row or column and vice-versa.

###### `shift: boolean`

Has effect only on two-dimensional composites. If enabled, moving up or down when there's no next item or the next item is disabled will shift to the item right before it.

###### `registerItem: (item: Item) => void`

Registers a composite item.

###### `unregisterItem: (item: Item) => void`

Unregisters a composite item.

###### `registerGroup: (group: Group) => void`

Registers a composite group.

###### `unregisterGroup: (group: Group) => void`

Unregisters a composite group.

###### `move: (id: string | null) => void`

Moves focus to a given item ID.

###### `next: () => void`

Moves focus to the next item.

###### `previous: () => void`

Moves focus to the previous item.

###### `up: () => void`

Moves focus to the item above.

###### `down: () => void`

Moves focus to the item below.

###### `first: () => void`

Moves focus to the first item.

###### `last: () => void`

Moves focus to the last item.

###### `sort: () => void`

Sorts the composite.items based on the items position in the DOM. This is especially useful after modifying the composite items order in the DOM. Most of the time, though, you don't need to manually call this function as the re-ordering happens automatically.

###### `setRTL: boolean>`

Sets rtl.

###### `setOrientation: "horizontal" | "vertical" | undefined`

Sets orientation.

###### `setCurrentId: string | null | undefined`

Sets currentId. This is different from composite.move as this only updates the currentId state without moving focus. When the composite widget gets focused by the user, the item referred by the currentId state will get focus.

###### `setLoop: boolean | "horizontal" | "vertical"`

Sets loop.

###### `setWrap: boolean | "horizontal" | "vertical"`

Sets wrap.

###### `seShift: boolean>`

Sets shift.

###### `reset: () => void`

Resets to initial state.

###### `selected?: boolean`

Set if a pill is in a selected state.

###### `element?: string`

Set a custom element name. Default: `FORM_PILL`

###### `onSelect?: () => void`

Event handler called when a pill is selected.

###### `onDismiss?: () => void`

Event handler called when a pill is dismised.

###### `onFocus?: () => void`

Event handler called when a pill is focused.

###### `onBlur?: () => void`

Event handler called when a pill is blurred.

###### `currentId?: string`

The current focused item id.

- undefined will automatically focus the first enabled composite item.
- null will focus the base composite element and users will be able to navigate out of it using arrow keys.
- If currentId is initially set to null, the base composite element itself will have focus and users will be able to navigate to it using arrow keys.

###### `orientation?: horizontal | vertical`

Defines the orientation of the composite widget. If the composite has a single row or column (one-dimensional), the orientation value determines which arrow keys can be used to move focus:

- undefined: all arrow keys work.
- horizontal: only left and right arrow keys work.
- vertical: only up and down arrow keys work.

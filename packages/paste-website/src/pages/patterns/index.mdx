## What is a pattern?

Patterns outline how to bring a collection of components together into a reusable solution that solves customer problems and delivers cohesion across our platforms. They are set of guidelines around a particular user flow or interaction that designers and engineers should follow when creating customer experiences.

There are two primary goals of patterns:

- To drive efficiency across Twilio product teams by ensuring that no one needs to solve the same problem twice.
- To establish cohesion across the full Twilio platform so that users do not need to re-learn how to perform certain actions as they move from product to product.

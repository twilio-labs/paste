## Guidelines

### About Form

Use the Form component to arrange a layout of form elements with preset spacing.
The Form component renders an HTML form element and comes with default behavior from the browser ([learn more about HTML form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)). Form elements are displayed vertically by default, but also support horizontal and 2-column layouts.

Common form components include [Buttons](/components/button), [Comboboxes](/components/combobox), [Checkboxes](/components/checkbox), [Date Picker](/components/date-picker), [File Picker](/components/file-picker), [Form Pill Groups](/components/form-pill-group), [Help Text](/components/help-text), [Inputs](/components/input), [Label](/components/label), [Radio Group](/components/radio-group), [Selects](/components/select), [Switch](/components/switch), [Textarea](/components/textarea), and [Time Picker](/components/time-picker).

Designing a good form requires making decisions about composition, sequence, form elements, copy, and feedback.

- Forms often have a header, with a [Heading](/components/heading) and [Paragraph](/components/paragraph) that explains the purpose of the form or form section. The header can also include additional contextual components like [Alerts](/components/alert) or [Callouts](/components/alert) for expressing errors or other important information.
- Forms can include [form actions](/components/form#form-actions), often with a primary Button ordered first, then a secondary Button second.
- More complex forms should be split into sections, known as fieldsets. [Form sections](/components/form#sections) are separated with a [Separator](/components/separator). Sections often have their own header, with a Heading, known as a legend, and can also include a Paragraph to explain the section.

### Accessibility

#### Order

- Order forms sequentially, following the natural flow of the user's language preference. Typically top to bottom, and left to right for Latin-based languages.
- Only use a single Form per page.
- Don’t use CSS to control element order. Form elements should be displayed in the same order in the HTML as they appear on screen, as screen readers announce form elements in the order they appear in the HTML.

#### Content

- Provide accessible and clear [Labels](/components/label) and [Help Text](/components/help-text).
  - Labels should clearly describe the value being requested.
  - Labels should be short and succinct, generally 1-3 words.
  - Help Text is optional. Use it to describe what makes the form field successful and help users avoid errors.
  - Avoid placeholder text. It is not broadly supported by assistive technologies, does not display in older browsers, and disappears from the field when a user enters text.
- Use fieldsets and legends.
  - When you need to group related form elements, use a [form section](/components/form#sections), which renders a HTML fieldset. To add clarity to the section, use a form section Heading, which renders a HTML legend, to clearly describe the group. It should be concise and descriptive.
  - You can have nested form sections if applicable.
  - Embed multiple fieldsets and legends for more complex forms.
- Use Help Text for [form validation errors](/patterns/error-state#when-to-use-which-component). For successful submissions, use a [Toast](/components/toast)

#### Composition

- Don’t make the user repeat information. For example, asking for users to input a shipping address and billing address if the address is the same information.
- Mark all required form elements as required.
- Consider breaking long forms into smaller sections or pages, as they can place more cognitive load on the user.
- Follow best practices for accessibility for each component used within the Form.
- Use a single column layout, as it can be more difficult for users with limited vision to scan from right to left if a multi-column layout is used.

#### Keyboard interaction

There are no special keyboard interactions for the Form component. The user should be able to tab through the form elements in the natural tab order.

## Examples

### Sample form

This example combines all of the separate features of the Form component into one. It shows how all the features work together harmoniously through a composition.

<Callout variant="neutral">
  <CalloutHeading as="h4">Accessibility insight</CalloutHeading>
  <CalloutText>
    Make sure to connect the Label to the Input. This is done with the <InlineCode>htmlFor</InlineCode> prop on the
    label, and the <InlineCode>id</InlineCode> prop on the input. Those two need to match.
  </CalloutText>
  <CalloutText>
    If the input has any associated help text, the input should also use the <InlineCode>aria-describedby</InlineCode>{' '}
    prop that equals the <InlineCode>id</InlineCode> of the help text. This ensures screen readers know the help text
    ties directly to the input.
  </CalloutText>
</Callout>

<Box paddingTop="space70" />

### Single column

Single-column layouts are easier to read. To learn more, check out some [research on form readability](https://baymard.com/blog/avoid-multi-column-forms). Horizontal layouts can create problems for people who rely on the structural layout of the page. [Read more on single column vs. multi-column layouts](/components/form#single-column-vs-multiple-columns).

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    Form,
    FormActions,
    FormControl,
    Heading,
    Input,
    Label,
    Button,
    Select,
    Option,
    Radio,
    RadioGroup,
    useUIDSeed,
  }}
  language="jsx"
  noInline
>
  {singleColumnForm}
</LivePreview>

### 2 column

Use more than 1 column only when it is clearer than a single column and prevents users from inputting incorrect information. Reserve 2-column layouts for when inputs are organized linearly or as a coherent entity, like dates, first and last name, or, ZIP, city, and state or credit card details fields. [Read more on single column vs. multi-column layouts](/components/form#single-column-vs-multiple-columns).

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    Form,
    FormActions,
    FormControl,
    FormControlTwoColumn,
    Heading,
    Paragraph,
    Label,
    Button,
    DatePicker,
    TimePicker,
    useUIDSeed,
  }}
  language="jsx"
  noInline
>
  {twoColumnForm}
</LivePreview>

### Horizontal layouts

Use a horizontal layout when options can be placed next to each other in a logical order and the labels for each element are shorter than 3 words.

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    Form,
    FormActions,
    FormControl,
    Heading,
    Paragraph,
    Radio,
    RadioGroup,
    Checkbox,
    CheckboxGroup,
    Button,
    useUIDSeed,
  }}
  language="jsx"
  noInline
>
  {horizontalForm}
</LivePreview>

### Sections

Use sections to group related content or steps within a Form. A section is separated using a [Separator](/components/separator), with `$space-90` above and below it.

Section headings and descriptions are optional.

If a form element doesn’t belong to a form sections, make sure there's at least `$space-130` between the form element and surrounding sections.

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    Form,
    FormActions,
    FormControl,
    FormSection,
    FormSectionDescription,
    FormSectionHeading,
    Separator,
    SearchIcon,
    Heading,
    Input,
    Label,
    Button,
    Select,
    Option,
    useUIDSeed,
    HelpText,
    Paragraph,
  }}
  language="jsx"
  noInline
>
  {sectionsForm}
</LivePreview>

### Form actions

A Form can include form actions if placed within a page or page section. Using form actions helps keep the form elements left-aligned for better scannability of the content and its related actions. Don't prevent form submission by disabling the submit button. Use [error messages](/patterns/error-state) to explain what information is missing or incorrect.

<LivePreview scope={{FormActions, Button}} language="jsx" noInline>
  {formActionsExample}
</LivePreview>

### Validation

Use validation and [error messaging](/components/form#errors) to indicate when a form submission fails or requires additional information to be shown.

Validate form fields on form submission. Validating a form field when the user leaves the current field (on blur) can be helpful to check for syntax errors. However, this can be frustrating to users who tab through controls to navigate a page, and to screen reader users, who might not be able to detect that an error occurred on blur.

Don't prevent form submission by disabling the submit button. Assistive technologies cannot detect disabled buttons. Use error messages to explain what information is missing or incorrect.

#### Errors

Use [Help Text](/components/help-text) to show inline error messaging that informs users that they cannot continue. Provide guidance on next steps and how to remedy the situation.

If there are multiple errors, use Help Text to show inline error messages and a [Callout to show an error summary](/components/callout#callout-with-a-list). Place the Callout below the form title or section title, if applicable, and above the form elements.

If the Form lives within a [Modal](/components/modal) or [Side Modal](/components/side-modal) and has a form action to submit or save the information, we suggest closing the Modal on submit, then display a Toast that indicates the action was successful or experienced a system error.

Error messaging for required fields should explain how to resolve the error and not reiterate that the field is required. The required field indicator is sufficient. For additional guidance on how to compose error messages, refer to the [error state pattern](/patterns/error-state).

Ideally, [Help Text](/components/help-text) should have enough information to help users prevent errors. If Help Text is already on a form field, change it to `variant=“error”` and add error copy before the original help text copy.

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    Form,
    FormActions,
    FormControl,
    FormControlTwoColumn,
    HelpText,
    Callout,
    CalloutHeading,
    CalloutList,
    CalloutListItem,
    Heading,
    Input,
    Label,
    Button,
    Select,
    Option,
    useUIDSeed,
  }}
  language="jsx"
  noInline
>
  {errorExample}
</LivePreview>

## Fixed width vs. full width

Forms can be set to any width needed for the desired form composition. When no max width is set, the form will be set to 100% of the parent container.

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    Form,
    FormActions,
    FormControl,
    Heading,
    Input,
    Label,
    Button,
    Select,
    Option,
    Radio,
    RadioGroup,
    useUIDSeed,
  }}
  language="jsx"
  noInline
>
  {singleColumnForm}
</LivePreview>

For fixed-width needs, you can use field length to help hint at the length of content required.

<LivePreview
  scope={{
    Form,
    FormActions,
    FormControl,
    Heading,
    Input,
    Label,
    Button,
    Select,
    Option,
    Radio,
    RadioGroup,
    useUIDSeed,
  }}
  language="jsx"
  noInline
>
  {maxWidthForm}
</LivePreview>

## Composition notes

### Form layout

The Form component ensures there is adequate spacing between form elements so users know which label belongs to which input. Typically, 50-75% of the height of a form element helps create this adequate spacing, so we’ve chosen to use `$space-80` between all form elements.

#### Single column vs. multiple columns

For most forms, use a single-column layout. Multiple columns disrupt a user's vertical momentum, and can cause users to interpret the fields inconsistently. For a form with a horizontal layout, the user would need to scan in Z-patterns, which can inhibit comprehension and completion of the form. But if a form is in a single column, the path to completion is clearer, as it’s a straight line down the page.

#### Group related information

Group related information in logical sections to aid in scanning and completion of a form. The flow from one set of questions to the next will better resemble a conversation. Grouping related fields together also helps users make sense of the information that they must fill in.

### Composing a form

#### Amount of form elements

The process of completing forms should be as simple and easy as possible. Take the time to evaluate every question you add to your forms and strive for succinctness. Be vigilant about removing everything that isn’t necessary.

Before adding more form elements, ask yourself:

- Do you really need to ask this question?
- Is it information that you can get automatically?
- Is there a better time or place to get an answer from our users?

#### Form order

##### Order the form layout logically

When ordering your form, use logical sequencing. Questions should be asked logically from a user’s perspective, not the application or database’s logic. For example, it’s unusual to ask for someone’s address before their name.

##### Organization: when to break into sections or new pages

Once you’ve determined how many form fields to include in a form, you’ll need to decide how to best break the form into sections. If a form naturally breaks down into a few short topics, a single page is likely to be a good way to organize the form. When a form becomes long and has a large number of questions that are only related by a few topics, multiple pages may be a better way to organize the form.

#### Field length

Where possible, ensure that field lengths provide meaningful affordances that help people answer questions effectively. Otherwise, use a consistent length that provides enough room for correct answers.

#### Optional vs. mandatory

Make required and optional fields distinguishable. Try to avoid optional input fields in forms.

- If most of the inputs on a form are required, indicate the few that are optional.
- If most of the inputs on a form are optional, indicate the few that are required.

Text is the clearest way to indicate whether a field is required or optional. However, the required symbol is relatively well understood. If you use the required symbol to indicate required fields, you'll see a "Required" title on the symbol. If you're building for other languages, use the `i18nLabel` prop to translate the "Required" title.

#### Selection methods

##### Single selection

| [Select](/components/select) or [Singleselect Combobox](/components/combobox)                                      | Use it when you have more than 6 options in a fixed list and users need to select only one at a time.|
| [Singleselect Combobox - Autocomplete](/components/combobox#autocomplete-combobox) | Use it when you have lists with over 15 options or if users need to search through a database and select a single option at a time.|

##### Multiple selection

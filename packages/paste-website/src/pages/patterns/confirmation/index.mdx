## Usage

### General

Use a confirmation to ask the user to verify that they want to proceed with a complex action, or one with significant or unanticipated consequences (like irreversibility). Confirmation messages are always triggered by an initial user action.
Confirmations are displayed using an [Alert Dialog](/components/alert-dialog), since it requires the user to interact with the component.

### Composition notes

Each confirmation [Alert Dialog](/components/alert-dialog) should follow a predictable content pattern.

#### Heading

The [Heading](/components/heading) should be phrased as a question. In general:

- Avoid using articles like “the” or “a.”
- Avoid the phrase “Are you sure?”
- Use sentence case.

#### Paragraph (optional)

The [Paragraph](/components/paragraph) should include 1-3 sentences that explain the outcomes of the actions. If the action is irreversible, say so.

#### Buttons

Confirmation messages typically have 2 [Buttons](/components/button): one that confirms the action and another that offers an alternative. Labels should be short and mirror the language in the title whenever possible.

## Variations

Confirmation messages are used in a variety of situations where it’s important to confirm that the user wants to proceed with an action, like saving changes before exiting, starting a process that could incur unexpected costs, or [deleting something](/patterns/delete).

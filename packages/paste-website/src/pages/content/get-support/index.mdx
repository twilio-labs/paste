### Quick self-serve checklist

How do you know if your content is "done" or "good"?

#### The tone is appropriate to the scenario.

- A stressful scenario is managed empathetically, with a knowledgeable and encouraging tone. Reassure and inform the user clearly.
- A win or success is managed genuinely, with a positive and encouraging tone. Celebrate with the user genuinely.
- A repeated interaction is managed efficiently, with a positive and conversational tone. Support the user's flow by reducing friction.
- The content sounds like a frinedly specialist.

#### The content meets the user's immediate needs.

- The user has enough information to understand the context and proposition, the impact of an action/decision, and clarity over what happens next.

#### The words and structure are as simple as they can be.

- You've replaced jargon with a simpler term or explained technical language or acronyms.
- Sentences are short.

#### The message is clear and unambiguous.

- Your content can only be interpreted one way.
- You've replaced any vague or imprecise language with precise, clear terms.

#### You've checked it. Twice.

- Capitals, punctuation, and spelling all align with this guide.
- Tip: Read it out loud to yourself. If it doesn't "sound right", consider changing the wording or phrasing.

#### Someone unfamiliar with the project has read and understood it.

- Ask them to read it out loud, then tell you what it means.
- If their understanding matches your intent, great! Your content is clear.
- If they stumble on words or don't understand, ask why. Use their feedback to iterate, then try again.
